{/* Review Tier Badge - Place immediately after header */}
<div className="mb-6">
  <Tier2Badge showDescription={true} />
</div>
```

### 2. TESTING TIMELINE DISCLOSURE (Required at top)
```markdown
## üîÑ Active Testing Status

**Testing Started:** [Month Day, Year]
**Days in Testing:** [X days]
**Current Phase:** [Initial Impressions / Extended Testing / Final Evaluation]
**Next Update:** [Expected date - typically 2-4 weeks]

**Testing Environment:**
- Location: Home kitchen
- Usage Frequency: [Daily / 3-4x week / Weekly]

```

### 4. TRANSPARENCY LANGUAGE (Critical for Tier 2)

Use these disclosure patterns throughout:

- "Based on X weeks of testing so far..."
- "I'm still evaluating [specific aspect]..."
- "Initial experience suggests... but I need more time to confirm..."
- "This review will be updated as I discover more through daily use"
- "Too early to assess long-term durability, but here's what I'm watching for..."
- "I'll update this section in 2 weeks once I've tested [specific scenario]"

### 5. COMPARISON TO TIER 1 PRODUCTS (When Applicable)

```markdown
## How This Compares to My Tier 1 Tested Products

[Honest comparison that acknowledges the difference in testing depth]
```

### 6. RATING STRUCTURE FOR TIER 2

```markdown
# Ninja Professional Blender (BL610) Review: 45 Days of Active Home Testing

## üîÑ Active Testing Status

**Testing Started:** September 1, 2025
**Days in Testing:** 45 days
**Current Phase:** Extended Testing
**Next Update:** November 15, 2025

**Testing Environment:**
- Location: Home kitchen (daily smoothies, weekly soups)
- Usage Frequency: 5-6 times per week
- Primary Uses: Morning smoothies, frozen fruit processing, hot soup blending
- Comparison Product: Testing against Vitamix 5200 (my Tier 1 product with 18 months restaurant testing)

{/* Review Tier Badge */}
<div className="mb-6">
  <Tier2Badge showDescription={true} />
</div>

## What I've Learned So Far

**First Impressions (Days 1-7):**
Out of the box, I was impressed by the build quality for a $90 blender. The 1000-watt motor feels substantial, and the blade assembly is aggressive. My concern: the plastic pitcher feels thin compared to my commercial Vitamix.

**After 2 Weeks:**
Daily smoothie performance is excellent. Crushes frozen fruit without hesitation. However, I'm noticing the motor gets warm after 60+ seconds of continuous blending‚Äîsomething I never experienced with the Vitamix in commercial settings.

**After 30 Days:**
The pitcher is showing fine scratches from daily use and aggressive cleaning. Blending performance remains consistent, but I'm monitoring the motor temperature closely during hot soup blending (the manual says it's safe, but it concerns me based on my equipment testing experience).

**Current Assessment (Day 45):**
This is a capable home blender that handles daily smoothie duty well. For $90, it's delivering value. However, I need 30-60 more days to assess:
- Long-term motor durability under daily use
- Whether the pitcher scratching affects performance
- How it handles winter soup season (higher-temperature blending)

## Still Testing

**Durability Concerns I'm Monitoring:**
- Motor heat during extended blending sessions (tracking temperatures)
- Pitcher material degradation from daily cleaning
- Blade sharpness over time (will test at 90 days)
- Seal integrity (checking for leaks weekly)

**Comparison to Tier 1 Products:**
Unlike my Vitamix 5200 which I tested for 18 months in a 200+ cover restaurant, this Ninja is undergoing home testing. The Vitamix never showed motor heat issues even after 45-minute continuous sessions in commercial use. The Ninja gets noticeably warm after 90 seconds. Is this a problem? Too early to say, but I'm watching it.

## Provisional Assessment (Subject to Change)

**Build Quality:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (3/5 based on 45 days)
- Motor: Solid performance but runs warm
- Pitcher: Functional but showing wear faster than expected
- Blades: Excellent so far, still sharp
- Base: Stable and well-designed

**Performance:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (4/5 in home use)
- Crushes ice: Excellent
- Frozen fruit smoothies: Excellent
- Hot soup blending: Good (but motor heat is concerning)
- Nut butters: Haven't tested yet (planned for Day 60)

**Value for Money:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (4/5 provisionally)
- At $90, performance is impressive
- Durability unknown‚Äîneed 60+ more days to confirm
- If it lasts 2+ years with daily use, it's a steal
- If it fails at 12-18 months, the Vitamix is better value long-term

## Bottom Line So Far

After 45 days of daily testing, the Ninja BL610 is performing well for home smoothie and soup duty at an excellent price point. However, I have concerns about long-term durability based on the motor heat and pitcher wear I'm observing.

**This review will be updated:**
- **Day 60:** Nut butter testing, long-term smoothie performance
- **Day 90:** Durability assessment, final provisional rating
- **6 Months:** If it's still performing well, may upgrade to Tier 1 status with full rating

**Who Should Consider This NOW (Based on 45 Days):**
‚úÖ Home users making 1-2 smoothies daily
‚úÖ Budget-conscious buyers wanting good performance
‚úÖ People willing to replace every 2-3 years if needed

**Who Should Skip This:**
‚ùå Commercial operations (not rated for that)
‚ùå Users needing 3+ minutes continuous blending
‚ùå Anyone wanting 5+ year durability guarantee (unknown yet)

---

**Transparency Note:** This is an active testing review. My opinion is evolving as I use this product daily. Unlike my Tier 1 reviews based on 18+ months of commercial testing, this represents 45 days of home use. I'm sharing my honest real-time experience as I discover what works and what doesn't.

**Next Update:** November 15, 2025 (Day 75)

## WHEN TO DOWNGRADE OR REMOVE A TIER 2 REVIEW

If during testing you discover:
- Product fails or breaks
- Performance degrades significantly
- You can't recommend it honestly

**Options:**
1. **Update with negative findings:** Keep review but be brutally honest about failures
2. **Add "Not Recommended" badge:** Update review to warn readers
3. **Remove from Tier 2, write failure report:** Create transparency post about what went wrong

**Example Failure Report:**
```markdown
# Ninja BL610 Update: Removed from Tier 2 After Motor Failure

After 67 days of testing, the Ninja BL610 motor failed during normal smoothie blending. Based on this experience and my professional equipment testing background, I can no longer recommend this product.

**What Happened:** [Detailed failure description]
**Why It Matters:** [Professional context]
**Alternative Recommendation:** [Better option with explanation]

This is why I test products before making long-term recommendations.
```
