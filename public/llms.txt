# Chef Approved Tools

> Professional kitchen equipment reviews and buying guides from a chef with 24 years of professional kitchen experience. Every product recommendation is based on actual professional kitchen use or extensive long-term home testing—not manufacturer claims or spec sheet comparisons.

Chef Approved Tools provides honest, experience-based reviews of kitchen equipment for home cooks who want professional-quality recommendations. The site is written and maintained by Scott Bradley, a culinary professional who has worked at Purple Café (Seattle), Mellow Mushroom, Feierabend, Il Pizzaiolo, and Paragary's.

Unlike typical affiliate review sites, product recommendations come from:
- Tier 1: Professional kitchen use (products tested daily in restaurant operations)
- Tier 2: Long-term personal testing (1+ years of regular home use)
- Tier 3: Expert evaluation (professional analysis based on 24 years of category expertise)

The site covers knives, cookware, kitchen appliances, prep tools, and cleaning/maintenance equipment. All content is written for home cooks seeking professional-grade guidance without marketing hype.
