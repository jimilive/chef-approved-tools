### Products Referenced in Guides/Bundles (Not in Reviews):
- Henckels 10-Inch Sharpening Steel (NO REVIEW PAGE EXISTS - needs full creation)
- Gourmia Pizza Oven (NO REVIEW PAGE EXISTS - needs full creation)

### Why Nordic Ware Half Sheet Pan Has No Link Listed:
- Product exists in reviews with `affiliateLinks: []`
- Already configured to fetch from Supabase
- Link IS in Supabase database, not in fallback code
- This is CORRECT implementation âœ…

### Insight: Why We Were Missing Products
Initial analysis only captured products with fallback URLs in code. Products already fully integrated with Supabase (like Nordic Ware) weren't listed. All 36 review products ARE migrated and working correctly. The "missing" items are:
1. Henckels Sharpening Steel - **No review page exists, needs full creation**
2. Gourmia Pizza Oven - **No review page exists, needs full creation**
3. Hotel pan lids - Oversight during original creation, need product entries
