## 🎯 Your Competitive Advantage

Most affiliate sites only track:
- Page views
- Clicks on affiliate links

**You now track:**
- Product impressions (what users SEE, not just click)
- CTA visibility patterns (where users look but don't click)
- Device-specific behavior (optimize for mobile separately)
- Content engagement quality (time-in-view, scroll patterns)
- Conversion funnel steps (full user journey)

This means you can optimize at a level your competitors can't match.

## 📈 Data Collection Timeline

| Timeframe | What You Can Do |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Day 1** | Check that tracking works (console logs, dataLayer) |
| **Day 2-7** | Let data collect, check daily for issues |
| **Week 2** | First meaningful insights available |
| **Week 3** | Start making optimization decisions |
| **Week 4+** | Continuous optimization cycle |

**Note:** GA4 has a 24-48 hour delay for new events in reports. Use DebugView for real-time testing.

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Start Small
Don't try to implement everything at once:
1. Start with homepage (biggest impact)
2. Add to top 3 review pages (your money makers)
3. Expand to all pages over time

### Check Data Early
Don't wait a week to check if tracking works:
- Day 1: Check console logs
- Day 2: Check dataLayer
- Day 3: Check GA4 DebugView
- Week 2: Check real reports

### Focus on Decisions
Data is useless without action:
- Set aside time each Monday
- Pick top 3 insights
- Make 1-2 changes per week
- Measure results
- Repeat

### Don't Overthink It
You don't need to be a data scientist:
- Use the "Top 5 Reports" from GA4 guide
- Look for obvious patterns
- Trust your instincts + data
- Make small, incremental improvements
