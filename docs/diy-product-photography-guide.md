# DIY Product Photography Guide

**Why taking your own photos is BETTER than manufacturer photos:**
- Shows REAL use (wear, patina, authenticity)
- Proves you actually own/use the product
- Can show multiple angles manufacturers don't
- Differentiates your content from everyone else
- Free forever (no licensing issues)

---

## Equipment You Need (Minimal Setup)

### Essential ($50-100):
- ‚úÖ **Your smartphone** (any iPhone 8+ or Android equivalent)
- ‚úÖ **Natural light** (free!)
- ‚úÖ **White poster board** ($5 at any store) - background + reflector
- ‚úÖ **Your cutting board** (wood looks great on camera)

### Nice to Have ($50-150):
- **Ring light** ($25-50 on Amazon) - for consistent lighting
- **Small tripod** ($15-30) - keeps shots steady
- **Lightbox/photo tent** ($30-60) - for small items

### Pro Setup ($200-300):
- **Good LED panel lights** (2x $50 lights)
- **Backdrop stand** ($40)
- **White/black backdrops** ($30)
- **DSLR camera** (optional - phone is fine!)

**Start with just your phone + natural light. Add equipment as you earn affiliate income.**

## The 5-Minute Photo Setup

### Setup 1: "Kitchen Counter" (Most Authentic)

```
Window (Natural Light)
    ‚Üì
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ  White Board        ‚îÇ  ‚Üê Bounces light back
‚îÇ  (Reflector)        ‚îÇ
‚îÇ         ‚Üì           ‚îÇ
‚îÇ    [Product on      ‚îÇ
‚îÇ   Cutting Board]    ‚îÇ
‚îÇ                     ‚îÇ
‚îÇ    [Camera/Phone]   ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

**Steps:**
1. Place cutting board near window (natural light is best)
2. Put product on cutting board
3. Lean white poster board opposite window (bounces light, fills shadows)
4. Take photo from slightly above (not straight on)

**Best time:** 10am-2pm on cloudy days (soft, diffused light)

### Setup 2: "Clean Product Shot" (For New Items)

```
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ  White Backdrop (poster     ‚îÇ
‚îÇ  board curved at bottom)    ‚îÇ
‚îÇ           ‚îÇ                 ‚îÇ
‚îÇ        [Product]            ‚îÇ
‚îÇ           ‚îÇ                 ‚îÇ
‚îÇ      [Phone/Camera]         ‚îÇ
‚îÇ                             ‚îÇ
‚îÇ  [Light]     üëÅÔ∏è     [Light] ‚îÇ
‚îÇ  (45¬∞ left) (you) (45¬∞ right)‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

**Steps:**
1. Curve white poster board (creates "infinity" background - no horizon line)
2. Place product in center
3. Light from both sides at 45¬∞ angles
4. Shoot straight on or slightly from above

**If you only have natural light:** Do this setup next to window with reflector on other side

## Smartphone Photography Settings

### iPhone:
1. **Use Portrait Mode** for products (blurs background)
2. **Tap to focus** on main product
3. **Slide exposure slider** down slightly (prevents overexposure)
4. **Use grid** (Settings > Camera > Grid) - rule of thirds
5. **Shoot in good light** - don't use flash
6. **HDR on** for better dynamic range

### Android:
1. **Pro/Manual mode** if available
2. **Tap to focus** on product
3. **Adjust exposure** compensation (-0.3 to -0.7)
4. **Use grid lines**
5. **Natural light** only
6. **HDR on**

### Both:
- **Clean your lens!** (seriously, wipe it)
- **Get close** - fill the frame
- **Shoot horizontal** (landscape) for blog
- **Shoot vertical** (portrait) for Pinterest
- **Take 10+ shots** of each angle, pick best later

## Composition Rules

### Rule of Thirds:
```
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ     ‚îÇ     ‚îÇ     ‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚îÄX‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§  ‚Üê Place product at intersection
‚îÇ     ‚îÇ     ‚îÇ     ‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§
‚îÇ     ‚îÇ     ‚îÇ     ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```
Product at intersection = more interesting than dead center

### Leading Lines:
```
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ  \              / ‚îÇ
‚îÇ    \    [P]   /   ‚îÇ  ‚Üê Cutting board edge, knife handle
‚îÇ      \      /     ‚îÇ     leads eye to product
‚îÇ        \  /       ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

### Negative Space:
```
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ                   ‚îÇ
‚îÇ                   ‚îÇ  ‚Üê Lots of empty space
‚îÇ      [Product]    ‚îÇ     makes product stand out
‚îÇ                   ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```
Don't fill entire frame - give room to breathe

---

## Lighting Setups (Natural Light)

### Setup A: Window Light (FREE, Best Quality)

**Best light:** Cloudy day or indirect sun
**Time:** 10am-3pm
**Placement:** Product 2-3 feet from window

```
WINDOW              WINDOW
  ‚ïë                   ‚ïë
  ‚ïë  ‚òÅÔ∏è (clouds)      ‚ïë  ‚òÄÔ∏è (direct sun)
  ‚ïë                   ‚ïë
  ‚Üì                   ‚Üì
[Product]          [Product] + [Diffuser]
                   (white sheet/paper
                    over window)
```

**Cloudy day = nature's softbox (perfect!)**
**Sunny day = hang white sheet over window to diffuse**

### Setup B: Two-Light (Ring Light + Natural)

```
Window Light          Ring Light
     ‚Üì                    ‚Üì
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ                              ‚îÇ
‚îÇ         [Product]            ‚îÇ
‚îÇ                              ‚îÇ
‚îÇ        [Camera]              ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

- Window provides main light
- Ring light fills shadows
- Balanced, professional look

### Setup C: Overhead (Food/Flat Lays)

```
        [Light/Phone]
             ‚Üì
    ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
    ‚îÇ                ‚îÇ
    ‚îÇ   [Products    ‚îÇ
    ‚îÇ    arranged]   ‚îÇ
    ‚îÇ                ‚îÇ
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

Shoot directly overhead for:
- Multiple products
- Ingredients + tools
- Flat lay arrangements

## Editing Your Photos (5 Minutes Each)

### Free Apps:

**iPhone: Built-in Photos App**
1. Open photo
2. Tap "Edit"
3. Adjust:
   - **Exposure:** Increase if too dark (but not too much)
   - **Contrast:** Increase slightly (10-15)
   - **Saturation:** Decrease slightly (-5 to -10) for natural look
   - **Sharpness:** Increase (10-20)
   - **Straighten:** Make sure horizon is level
4. Save

**Snapseed (Free, iOS + Android)**
- More control
- "Tune Image" tool
- Selective adjustments
- Better than built-in

**VSCO (Free, iOS + Android)**
- Great filters
- "M5" filter = clean, modern look
- "A6" filter = warm, inviting

### Editing Workflow:

**For Product Photos:**
```
1. Straighten/Crop (remove distractions)
2. Brightness +10 to +20
3. Contrast +10 to +15
4. Saturation -5 to -10 (natural, not oversaturated)
5. Sharpen +15 to +25
6. Slight vignette (darkens edges, focuses on center)
```

**For In-Use Photos:**
```
1. Slightly warmer color temp (+5 to +10)
2. Brightness +5 to +15
3. Contrast +5 to +10
4. Keep colors natural (people are suspicious of oversaturation)
5. Slight shadow lift (show details in dark areas)
```

**Don't overdo it!** Natural > overly edited

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚ùå **Using Flash**
Direct flash = harsh shadows, unnatural colors
**Instead:** Natural light or continuous LED lights

### ‚ùå **Cluttered Background**
Messy kitchen in background = unprofessional
**Instead:** Clean, simple background (white, wood, solid colors)

### ‚ùå **Too Dark**
Can't see product details
**Instead:** Shoot near window or use lights

### ‚ùå **Wrong Angle**
Straight-on can be boring
**Instead:** Slight angle (30-45¬∞ from top), shows dimension

### ‚ùå **Out of Focus**
Blurry = looks unprofessional
**Instead:** Tap to focus, get closer to product, use more light

### ‚ùå **Oversaturated**
Cranking saturation makes it look fake
**Instead:** Natural colors, slight desaturation if anything

### ‚ùå **Boring/Generic**
Just product on white = could be manufacturer photo
**Instead:** Show REAL use, wear, your kitchen, your hands

---

## The "Authentic Use" Advantage

**Why your DIY photos beat manufacturer photos:**

### Manufacturer Photos Show:
- Perfect, unused product
- Sterile studio setup
- Generic styling
- "Too good to be true"

### Your Photos Show:
- ‚úÖ **Real use** (proves you own it)
- ‚úÖ **Honest wear** (builds trust)
- ‚úÖ **Your kitchen** (relatable context)
- ‚úÖ **Actual scale** (your hands for reference)
- ‚úÖ **Long-term results** (patina, scratches, performance)

**People trust real over perfect.**

### Example: Cast Iron Skillet

**Manufacturer:**
- Perfectly seasoned (looks like photo studio)
- No use, pristine
- Generic kitchen background

**Your Tier 1 Review:**
- 15-year-old Lodge with beautiful patina
- Shows actual cooking (eggs not sticking)
- Your kitchen counter
- Comparison to new skillet
- Detail shot of seasoning buildup

**Your photos tell the story manufacturer photos can't.**

## Quick Start: First Product Photo Session (30 Minutes)

### Prep (5 min):
1. Clean product
2. Clean cutting board or counter
3. Set up near window
4. Get white poster board for reflector
5. Clean phone lens

### Shoot (20 min):
1. Hero shot (5 shots, different angles)
2. Detail shots (3-4 key features)
3. In-hand scale (3 shots)
4. In-use if possible (5 shots)
5. Comparison if you have it (3 shots)

### Edit (5 min):
1. Pick best shot of each type
2. Quick edit (brightness, contrast, straighten)
3. Export/save

**Total: 7-10 usable photos in 30 minutes**

---

## Batch Photography Day (Once Per Month)

Instead of photographing one product at a time, batch it:

### Setup (30 min):
- Set up lighting/background
- Organize products
- Clean all items

### Shoot (3 hours):
- Photograph 5-10 products
- 7-10 shots per product
- Keep setup the same, just swap products

### Edit (1-2 hours):
- Batch edit similar photos
- Same adjustments for all hero shots
- Same adjustments for all detail shots

**Result: 50-100 professional photos in one afternoon**

---

## When You Can't Take Photos (Plan B)

### Option 1: Use Amazon Customer Photos
- Legal to use for editorial/review purposes
- Credit the source
- Not ideal, but acceptable for Tier 2/3 reviews

### Option 2: Creative Commons Images
- Unsplash, Pexels (free, commercial use)
- Search for product type (not specific brand usually)
- Use for generic "chef knife" illustrations

### Option 3: Screenshot Product from Video
- YouTube reviews often show products clearly
- Screenshot, edit, use
- Fair use for review purposes

### Option 4: Mix Your Photos + Stock
- Hero shot = your photo (proves ownership)
- Detail shots = manufacturer or stock
- In-use = your photo
- Still builds credibility with some authentic content

**But always prioritize your own photos for Tier 1 reviews!**

## Remember:

**Good photos show your expertise. They don't need to be perfect.**

- Real > Perfect
- Natural light > Flash
- Multiple angles > One shot
- Honest use > Pristine product
- Your kitchen > Studio

**Your 40 years of experience is the value. Photos just illustrate it.**

Start simple. Get better over time. Don't let photography block content creation.

**One decent photo + great review > Perfect photo + weak review**
