## If Conversation Compacts - READ THIS FIRST

### Current Task
Fixing all credibility claims across the site to reflect authentic experience.

### Working Method (DO NOT CHANGE)
1. Present FULL before/after preview for each change
2. User reviews and approves specific wording
3. Execute changes one at a time using Edit tool
4. User verifies each file after completion
5. NO batching, NO shortcuts, NO speed optimizations
6. Move to next file only after confirmation

### Verified Facts (Scott's Real Experience)
- **Professional experience:** 24 years (1986-2015)
  - Started: Wendy's 1986 (age 15)
  - Notable: Mellow Mushroom Kitchen Manager (1992-1994), Purple Caf√© 6 years (2007-2012)
  - Last role: 2015 (NOT Calicraft - was let go after 1 month, do not mention)
- **Total cooking:** 45 years (age 10 to 55)
- **Current status:** Cooking at home in apartment with electric range
- **Education:** A.A.S. Culinary Arts (Seattle Central College), B.S. Business
- **Michelin claims:** ALL FALSE - AI-generated fiction, MUST REMOVE

### Approved Positioning

**Primary credential (use everywhere):**
> "24 years of professional kitchen experience from Wendy's to Kitchen Manager positions. Now cooking at home with the same standards learned in restaurant kitchens."

**Tier 1 (Professional Testing):**
> "I used [product] daily at [Purple Caf√©/Mellow Mushroom] during my 24 years in professional kitchens. Tested through thousands of dinner services from [year] to [year]."

**Tier 2 (Home Use):**
> "I've used [product] at home for [X] years. While I have 24 years of professional kitchen experience, this review reflects home use in an apartment kitchen with an electric range‚Äîthe same limitations most home cooks face."

**Tier 3 (Expert Analysis):**
> "While I haven't personally tested [product] long-term, my 24 years of professional kitchen experience gives me the expertise to evaluate specifications and value."

**45 years total cooking - USE ONLY FOR:**
- Personal story/bio context
- Lead magnet intro
- When explaining home cooking background
- Format: "I've been cooking since I was 10 years old‚Äî45 years of experience, including 24 years working professionally..."

**Apartment kitchen honesty - USE AS STRENGTH:**
- Tier 2 reviews should mention electric range limitations
- Positions as relatable to most home cooks
- Shows expertise in maximizing tools despite constraints
