# Lead Magnet Content Quality Fixes
**Created:** October 20, 2025
**Status:** DEFERRED - Do after credibility fixes complete
**File:** `lib/lead-magnet-content.ts`

## Background
During credibility fix review, discovered multiple content accuracy and quality issues in lead magnet. Credibility claims have been fixed. These content improvements are deferred until after completing credibility fixes across all 50+ site files.

## Issues to Fix

### 1. Knife Work Percentage (Line ~22)
**Current:** "90% of my knife work happens with this 8-inch"
**Change to:** "80% of my knife work happens with this 8-inch"

### 2. Granton Boning Knife Description (Line ~35)
**Current:** "Flexible blade gets close to bones"
**Change to:** "Firm blade gets close to bones"
**Note:** Granton edge boning knife is FIRM, not flexible

### 3. Winco Tongs - Tier Classification (Line ~60-64)
**Current:** "These are the exact tongs I used in every restaurant kitchen"
**Issue:** This is Tier 3 (not personally tested), falsely presented as Tier 1
**Change to:** "These are a heavy duty version of the same style tongs used in every professional kitchen"

### 4. ZUPERIA Bar Mops - Verify Tier (Line ~74-78)
**Note:** Listed as Tier 3, but copy seems okay ("These are what restaurants actually use")
**Action:** Verify tier classification is accurate. Current copy may be fine.

### 5. "Managing Operations" Clarification (Line ~93)
**Current:** "managing operations at Mellow Mushroom"
**Change to:** "managing kitchen operations at Mellow Mushroom"
**Reason:** More specific and accurate

### 6. Dishwasher Section Rewrite (Line ~111)
**Current:** "dishwasher-safe handles (though I hand-wash the blades)"
**Change to:** Mention that user has run these through dishwasher after every use for 20 years, though Victorinox doesn't recommend it. Emphasize drying immediately after. Never leave sitting in water or with food on them.
**Note:** This is more authentic and useful

### 7. Care & Maintenance Section - Complete Overhaul (Lines 116-142)
**Issue:** User reaction: "EWWW GROSSS!"
**Action:** Needs complete rewrite
**Defer:** This is a larger rewrite project - do after all credibility fixes

### 8. Honing Steel Price Reference (Line ~152)
**Current:** "ðŸš« Expensive honing steel - The $15 one works identically"
**Change to:** "ðŸš« Expensive honing steel - A good honing steel doesn't need to cost $200"
**Reason:** Good honing steels cost more than $15. Don't give bad advice.

### 9. Rock the Knife Line (Line ~176)
**Current:** "â–¡ Rock the knife - Don't lift the tip off the board"
**Action:** Remove this line entirely
**Reason:** User wants this removed

### 10. Pricing in Tool Descriptions - Clarify
**Question for user:** Are the individual tool prices (lines 12, 19, 26, etc.) okay, or should these be removed?
**Note:** User said "we never use any prices unless in ROI or cost analysis"
**But:** Line 99 "Total Investment: About $320" is explicitly mentioned as appropriate
**Action needed:** Clarify if individual tool prices should stay or go

## Priority
- **DEFERRED** until after all 50+ files have credibility fixes completed
- These are quality/accuracy improvements, not trust-damaging claims
- Lead magnet is not actively being distributed yet
