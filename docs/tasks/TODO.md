2. **Contact Form Email Notifications**

   - [ ] Configure to send contact form submissions to your inbox
   - [ ] Note: Email Octopus only handles newsletter campaigns, not transactional emails
   - [ ] Update `/app/api/contact/route.ts` with chosen email service

2. **Email Sequences to Create**
   - [ ] Welcome email series (5-7 emails)
   - [ ] Product recommendation emails based on category interest

## üéØ CTA A/B Testing Implementation

### Phase 1: Testing (Before Deploy)
- [ ] Test locally with `npm run dev`
- [ ] Test button variations on 2-3 review pages
- [ ] Verify affiliate links contain `?tag=chefapprovedtools-20`
- [ ] Test sticky mobile CTA on phone/mobile view
- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Verify GA4 tracking fires (Network tab in dev tools)
- [ ] Test variant assignment: `localStorage.getItem('cta_variant')` in console
- [ ] Clear localStorage and verify new variant assigned on refresh

### Phase 2: Legal Clarification
- [ ] Contact Amazon Associates via https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/help/
- [ ] Ask about "Prime Eligible" text usage (no logo)
- [ ] Ask about available badges beyond "Available at Amazon"
- [ ] Ask about generic trust signals ("Free Returns Available", etc.)
- [ ] Get written confirmation on approved button text
- [ ] Save Amazon's response
- [ ] Update implementation based on their guidance

### Phase 3: Site Integration
- [ ] Choose 1 high-traffic review page to update first
- [ ] Update that page to use new AffiliateButton component
- [ ] Test updated page thoroughly
- [ ] Update remaining 26 review pages with new buttons
- [ ] Optionally add TrustSignals component to pages
- [ ] Verify all affiliate links still work

### Phase 4: Deploy to Production
- [ ] Commit changes with legal compliance message
- [ ] Push to main branch
- [ ] Monitor Vercel deployment dashboard
- [ ] Test on live site after deployment
- [ ] Verify affiliate links work on production

### Phase 5: Monitor & Optimize (2-4 weeks after deploy)
- [ ] Check GA4 for `cta_variant_assigned` events
- [ ] Compare click-through rates by variant (A, B, C)
- [ ] Need 100+ clicks per variant for statistical significance
- [ ] If clear winner (>10% difference), implement site-wide
- [ ] If no clear winner, continue testing or use best performer
- [ ] Monitor error tracking in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Check for user feedback/issues

**CTA Button Variations (Legal Compliant):**

- Variant B: "Check Current Price"
- Variant C: "See Product Details"
