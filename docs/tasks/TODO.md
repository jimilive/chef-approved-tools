## 🧲 Lead Magnet Strategy Audit (NOT STARTED - HIGH PRIORITY)

**⚠️ TRUST & COMPLIANCE CRITICAL**

This is a strategic audit to ensure we're not over-promising or breaking user trust with too many different lead magnets across the site.

### Goals:
1. **Inventory all lead magnets** - Find every lead magnet offer on the site (likely ~15 different ones)
2. **Assess consistency** - Determine if we're making conflicting promises to users
3. **Strategic consolidation** - Decide on optimal approach (single flagship lead magnet vs. multiple targeted ones)
4. **Trust evaluation** - Ensure we can actually deliver on every promise made

### Tasks:
- [ ] **Comprehensive site audit** - Identify all lead magnet offers and their locations
  - [ ] Homepage newsletter signup
  - [ ] Exit-intent popups
  - [ ] In-content lead magnet offers
  - [ ] Footer signups
  - [ ] Individual product page offers
  - [ ] Blog post lead magnets
  - [ ] Category page offers
  - [ ] Create spreadsheet: Location | Offer Text | Promised Deliverable | Status
- [ ] **Content audit** - Verify which lead magnets we've actually created
  - [ ] Count: How many different lead magnets have we promised?
  - [ ] Reality check: How many do we actually have written?
  - [ ] Gap analysis: What's promised but doesn't exist?
- [ ] **Research best practices** - SEO and conversion optimization
  - [ ] Single flagship lead magnet vs. multiple targeted lead magnets
  - [ ] Impact on user trust and brand consistency
  - [ ] Conversion rate optimization considerations
  - [ ] How many lead magnets do successful affiliate sites use?
- [ ] **Strategic decision** - Choose approach that maintains trust
  - [ ] Option A: Single high-quality lead magnet (easiest to deliver)
  - [ ] Option B: 3-5 targeted lead magnets by category
  - [ ] Option C: Custom lead magnet per major category
  - [ ] Decision criteria: Can we actually deliver on every promise?
- [ ] **Implementation plan** - Execute chosen strategy
  - [ ] Update all lead magnet offers to match chosen strategy
  - [ ] Remove or consolidate duplicate/conflicting offers
  - [ ] Ensure FTC compliance on all lead magnet pages
  - [ ] Create missing lead magnet content
  - [ ] Set up email delivery automation
- [ ] **Future opportunities** - Research monetization
  - [ ] Can we sell lead magnets on Etsy, Gumroad, or other platforms?
  - [ ] What's the market for kitchen equipment guides?
  - [ ] Potential for premium upgraded versions?

### Why This Matters:
- **Trust is everything** in affiliate marketing
- Over-promising and under-delivering damages credibility
- Multiple conflicting offers confuse users
- Need streamlined approach we can actually execute on
- Better to have 1-3 excellent lead magnets than 15 mediocre ones
