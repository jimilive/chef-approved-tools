    - BUT: Scott used this STYLE of tongs daily in every professional kitchen for 24 years

    - Every professional cook uses these style tongs daily

    - NOT this exact brand used by Scott
    - BUT: Scott used bar mops (ring-spun cotton) daily in every professional kitchen for 24 years
    - This is the professional standard (ring-spun cotton)
    - Every professional kitchen uses these

### CARE & MAINTENANCE - REAL TRUTH (Not the gross version)

**What Scott ACTUALLY Does:**
- Runs EVERYTHING through dishwasher daily (except bar mops)
- Been doing this for 20 years
- Everything survives perfectly
- Victorinox doesn't recommend dishwasher, but Scott does it anyway

**REAL Care Instructions (what needs to be in the rewrite):**

**KNIVES:**
- Hone/steel knives before each use (realigns the edge, doesn't sharpen)
  - Exception: Don't hone the serrated bread knife
- Run through dishwasher after use
- Dry immediately after dishwasher cycle (don't leave wet)
- Never leave soaking in water
- Never leave sitting with food on them (especially acidic like tomatoes)
- Sharpen when dull (professional or whetstone)

**EVERYTHING ELSE:**
- Dishwasher safe, run daily
- Don't leave soaking in water
- Don't leave with food sitting on them

**BAR MOPS:**
- Machine wash
- Hang to dry

**Current Care & Maintenance section (Lines 105-131) needs COMPLETE REWRITE.**
- Remove the Daily/Weekly/Monthly schedule (it's gross and wrong)
- Replace with realistic dishwasher-friendly care
- Emphasize: "I've done this for 20 years, everything still works perfectly"
