# CURRENT SETUP SUMMARY - EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

**Generated:** October 10, 2025
**Site:** Chef Approved Tools (www.chefapprovedtools.com)
**Purpose:** High-level summary of audit findings for Netlify ‚Üí Vercel migration

---

## üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Great news:** Your site is well-configured for migration! You already have `vercel.json` in place with basic redirects configured. The migration should be straightforward with low risk of issues.

### Migration Readiness: ‚úÖ **READY**

- ‚úÖ Next.js App Router architecture (platform-agnostic)
- ‚úÖ vercel.json already exists with redirect configuration
- ‚úÖ Environment variables documented
- ‚úÖ Affiliate tracking uses component-based system (portable)
- ‚úÖ Images hosted externally (Unsplash, Amazon CDN)
- ‚úÖ Schema markup properly implemented

---

## üìä WHAT I FOUND

### 1. Amazon Affiliate Implementation ‚≠ê **CRITICAL FOR REVENUE**

**Status:** ‚úÖ Well-structured and ready for migration

- **Affiliate Tag:** `chefapprovedtools-20`
- **Implementation:** Component-based (AffiliateButton)
- **Coverage:** 18 active review pages + homepage
- **Tracking:** Position-based analytics (above_fold, mid_article, final_cta)
- **Link Format:** Primarily `amzn.to` short links

**Migration Action Required:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **MUST SET** `AMAZON_ASSOCIATE_TAG=chefapprovedtools-20` in Vercel environment variables
- Test affiliate links post-migration to ensure tag appears in URLs

**See:** AMAZON_AFFILIATE_AUDIT.md for complete details

---

### 2. Redirect Configuration ‚úÖ **ALREADY CONFIGURED**

**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready - mostly configured in vercel.json and next.config.js

#### Active Redirects:
1. `/products/*` ‚Üí `/reviews/*` (301 permanent)
2. `/reviews/wusthof-classic-ikon-15-piece` ‚Üí `16-piece` (301 permanent)
3. `/go/amazon/*` ‚Üí `https://amazon.com/*` (302 temporary, unused)

#### Domain Redirects (automatic on Vercel):
- Non-www ‚Üí www (configure in Vercel domain settings)
- HTTP ‚Üí HTTPS (Vercel default)

**Migration Actions:**
- Set `www.chefapprovedtools.com` as primary domain in Vercel
- Test all redirects post-migration
- Delete `netlify.toml` after successful migration

**See:** REDIRECT_AUDIT.md for complete redirect inventory

---

### 3. Environment Variables üìã **NEEDS ATTENTION**

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Variables must be manually set in Vercel dashboard

#### Critical (Must Set):
- `AMAZON_ASSOCIATE_TAG=chefapprovedtools-20` ‚ö†Ô∏è **REVENUE CRITICAL**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://www.chefapprovedtools.com`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME=Chef Approved Tools`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=[get from Google Analytics]` ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDS CLARIFICATION**

#### Optional (Set if using):
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_HOTJAR_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FB_PIXEL_ID`
- Email service credentials (Mailchimp or ConvertKit)

**Migration Action:**
- Gather Google Analytics ID before migration
- Set all critical env vars in Vercel dashboard
- Choose Production + Preview + Development environments

**See:** ENV_VARIABLES_TEMPLATE.md for complete list and instructions

---

### 4. Performance Baselines üìà **DOCUMENTED**

**Found:**
- Lighthouse reports exist: `/reports/lighthouse.json`, `/lighthouse-mobile-report.json`
- Performance optimizations configured in `next.config.js`
- Image optimization enabled (AVIF, WebP formats)

**Current Optimizations:**
- React strict mode enabled
- SWC minification enabled
- Advanced webpack optimization
- Aggressive polyfill exclusion for modern browsers
- Image formats: AVIF, WebP with multiple device sizes

**Migration Benefit:**
- Vercel typically provides **faster** performance than Netlify for Next.js
- Edge caching and global CDN built-in
- Automatic image optimization

**No action required** - Optimizations are framework-level and will transfer automatically

---

### 5. Image Hosting üñºÔ∏è **EXTERNAL - NO MIGRATION NEEDED**

**Status:** ‚úÖ No action required

**Image Sources:**
- Unsplash CDN (`images.unsplash.com`)
- Amazon Media CDN (`m.media-amazon.com`, `images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com`)
- Local images in `/public/images/` (products, team, branding)

**Configuration:**
- `next.config.js` lines 52-69 specify remote image domains
- Images optimized via Next.js Image component

**Migration Impact:** None - external images and local images both work on Vercel

---

### 6. Internal Linking üîó **ADEQUATE**

**Status:** ‚úÖ Good internal linking structure

**Findings:**
- Review pages cross-link to related products
- Links to bundles and guides
- Breadcrumb navigation
- Footer navigation
- Category pages link to reviews

**Sample Count:**
- Le Creuset review: 3+ internal links to other reviews
- KitchenAid review: 5+ internal links to related content

**SEO Strategy:** Appears to follow 5-8 internal links per review page guideline

**No migration action needed** - Links are relative URLs and will work on any platform

---

### 7. Schema Markup üè∑Ô∏è **COMPREHENSIVE**

**Status:** ‚úÖ Well-implemented structured data

**Schema Types Found:**
- **Product Schema** - All review pages (`components/ProductSchema.tsx`)
- **FAQ Schema** - FAQ sections (`components/FAQSchema.tsx`)
- **Breadcrumb Schema** - Navigation (`components/BreadcrumbSchema.tsx`)
- **Review Schema** - Product reviews (`components/ReviewSchema.tsx`)

**Format:** JSON-LD (preferred by Google)

**Example** (KitchenAid review):
- Product schema with ratings, reviews, pricing
- Offer schema with availability and seller info
- FAQ schema with microdata markup

**Migration Impact:** None - Schema is HTML-based and platform-independent

**Post-migration action:**
- Test with Google Rich Results Test tool
- Verify schema still validates

---

### 8. Email Capture üìß **LIMITED IMPLEMENTATION**

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Forms exist but integration unclear

**Found:**
- Newsletter signup component (`components/Newsletter.tsx`)
- Forms in review pages linking to `/newsletter`
- Client-side tracking with `trackNewsletterSignup()`

**Not Found:**
- **No server-side email service integration**
- No API routes for form handling
- Environment variables for email services defined but unused

**Clarification Needed:**
- Are you using Mailchimp, ConvertKit, or another service?
- Or are signups handled externally?

**Migration Action:** Clarify email service integration before setting env vars

---

## üö® CRITICAL MIGRATION CONCERNS

### 1. Revenue Protection ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGHEST PRIORITY**

**Amazon affiliate links are the lifeblood of this site.**

**Must verify post-migration:**
- Affiliate tag `chefapprovedtools-20` appears in all Amazon links

- Click tracking functions work
- All 18 review pages have working affiliate buttons

**Test Before Going Live:**
- Click 5+ affiliate links on staging
- Inspect destination URLs for affiliate tag
- Verify tracking analytics fire

---

### 2. SEO Continuity ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Domain and URL structure must remain identical.**

**Must preserve:**
- www.chefapprovedtools.com as primary domain

- Redirects maintain 301 status for SEO equity
- Meta tags and Open Graph tags correct

**Test After Migration:**
- Google Search Console for crawl errors

- All redirects return correct status codes

---

### 3. Analytics Continuity ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Traffic and conversion data is essential.**

**Must configure:**
