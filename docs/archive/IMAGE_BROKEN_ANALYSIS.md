# Broken Images Analysis - P2

**Date:** 2025-10-08
**Issue:** Images not working on some product pages

---

## Root Cause Identified

**11 product review pages have NO product images displayed**

These pages exist but don't have any `<Image>` components to display product photos. They're text-only reviews without visuals, which hurts conversion and credibility.

## Image Folders WITHOUT Pages (Not a Problem)

These won't cause broken images since no pages reference them:

- cambro-6-pan
- cuisinart-egg-pan (has naming mismatch: folder contains `cuisinart-non-stick-pan-*.webp` files)
- garlic-chopper
- henckels-honing-steel
- knife-safe-knife-guard
- sani-bucket

---

## Evidence

### KitchenAid Page (line 81)
```typescript
openGraph: {
  images: ['/logo.png'],  // ← Fallback to logo because no product images exist
}
```

### Le Creuset Page (line 149)
```typescript
openGraph: {
  images: ['/logo.png'],  // ← Fallback to logo because no product images exist
}
```

Both pages use the site logo as fallback, confirming NO product images exist.

## Solutions

### For Group 1 (6 pages - no images, no folder):
1. **Create image folders** with product photos (from Amazon, stock photos, or user's own photos)
2. **Add `<Image>` components** to display the product photos on these pages

### For Group 2 (5 pages - images exist but not displayed):
1. **Add `<Image>` components** to these pages (images already exist!)
2. **Quick win** - just need to update the page code to display existing images
3. Copy the image display pattern from working pages (like oxo-good-grips-bench-scraper)

### Best Approach:
1. Start with Group 2 (easy win - images already exist)
2. Then tackle Group 1 (need to source/create images first)

## Impact

- **User Experience:** Broken images hurt credibility and conversion
- **SEO:** OpenGraph images default to site logo instead of product images
- **Conversion:** Product images are critical for affiliate sales

## Next Steps

1. User to decide: Which solution to implement?
2. If Option 1/3: Create/source images for all 6 products
3. If Option 2: Update pages to gracefully handle missing images
4. Verify fixes across all 6 pages
