## ‚úçÔ∏è Daily Content Creation Workflow

### Create a New Post (5 minutes)

```bash
# Product Review
./scripts/content-creation/new-post.sh review wusthof-classic-8-inch-knife

# Comparison Post
./scripts/content-creation/new-post.sh comparison wusthof-vs-shun

# Buying Guide
./scripts/content-creation/new-post.sh guide how-to-choose-chef-knife
```

This creates a new file from the template with:
- Proper directory structure
- All schema markup
- SEO-optimized layout
- Conversion-optimized CTAs

### Fill in the Template (2-3 hours)

**Hour 1: Research**
1. Open the new `page.tsx` file in VS Code
2. Research your topic:
   - Google the target keyword
   - Check "People Also Ask"
   - Review top 10 results
   - Note what's missing
   - Check Amazon reviews for product insights

**Hours 2-3: Write**
1. Fill in `productData` / `guideData` / `comparisonData`
2. Write each section:
   - Use VS Code snippets (type `productbox`, `proscons`, etc.)
   - Add personal testing experience
   - Include specific details and numbers
   - Insert comparison tables
   - Add pro tips and warnings
3. Write 1500-3000 words total

**Pro Tips:**
- Use the VS Code snippets extensively - they'll save hours
- Keep your writing conversational and authentic
- Share real experiences from your 40 years as a chef
- Be honest about pros AND cons

### Add Images (30 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Add raw images to temp folder
# Save your product photos to: public/images/temp/[product-name]/

  public/images/temp/[product-name] \
  public/images/products/[product-name]

# 3. Update image paths in your post
# Replace [ADD PRODUCT IMAGE] comments with actual image components
```

**Image Guidelines:**
- 5-7 images per post minimum

- Before/after if relevant
- Comparison shots for comparison posts
- All images will be auto-converted to WebP

### SEO Optimization (30 minutes)

1. **Update metadata:**
   ```tsx

     description: "Professional chef reviews [product]...",
     keywords: ["keyword1", "keyword2", ...]
   }
   ```

2. **Add internal links:**
   - Link to related product reviews
   - Link to buying guides
   - Link to comparison posts
   - Use descriptive anchor text

3. **Verify schema markup:**
   - Product schema (reviews)
   - FAQ schema (guides)
   - Breadcrumb schema (all pages)

4. **Check affiliate links:**
   - All Amazon links include: `?tag=chefapprovedt-20`
   - All have `rel="nofollow sponsored"`

### Test & Publish (15 minutes)

npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000/reviews/[your-slug]

# Check for:
# - All images load
# - Affiliate links work

# - No console errors

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Add [product name] review"
git push

# Netlify will auto-deploy
```

### Post-Publish (15 minutes)

1. **Submit to Google:**
   - Go to Google Search Console
   - Request indexing for new URL

2. **Update calendar:**
   - Mark post as ‚úÖ complete in `30-day-content-calendar.md`
