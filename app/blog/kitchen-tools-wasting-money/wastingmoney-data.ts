      {
        question: "What's the #1 tool most home cooks waste money on?",
        answer: "Single-use gadgets like garlic presses or avocado slicers. A good knife replaces them all."
      },
      {
        question: "Are expensive knife sets worth it?",
        answer: "Not for most cooks. One $50-$100 knife, properly maintained, will outperform a full designer set."
      },
      {
        question: "What cookware should I actually invest in?",
        answer: "One cast iron skillet, one stainless pan, one small nonstick. That's enough for 95% of meals."
      },
      {
        question: "Do professionals use the same tools at home?",
        answer: "Absolutely - just fewer of them. Pros value simplicity and reliability over novelty."
      },
      {
        question: "How do I know if a gadget is worth buying?",
        answer: "If it doesn't save time or improve consistency, skip it. The best tools disappear into your workflow."
      },
      {
        question: "What are the tools every home cook truly needs?",
        answer: "Chef knife, cutting board, scraper, thermometer, cast iron skillet, and tongs. Everything else is optional."
      },
      {
        question: "Should I replace all my cheap tools at once?",
        answer: "No. Replace them gradually as they wear out. Start with your most-used items: knife, cutting board, and primary pan. Quality over quantity."
      },
      {
        question: "Are expensive brands always better quality?",
        answer: "Not necessarily. Many professional-grade tools are unbranded or sold under commercial supplier names. Focus on construction quality, not marketing."
