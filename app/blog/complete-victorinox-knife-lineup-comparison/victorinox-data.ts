  faq: {
    questions: [
      {
        question: "Should I buy all 5 Victorinox knives at once?",
        answer: "No. Start with the 8-inch chef's knife and paring knife ($57 total). Use them for 6+ months. Add other knives only when you've identified specific, recurring tasks where you're struggling. Buying all 5 upfront means spending $192 on knives you might not need."
      },
      {
        question: "Which Victorinox knife should I buy first if I can only afford one?",
        answer: "The 8-inch chef's knife, hands down. It handles 80% of kitchen tasks. You can cook complete meals with just this one knife. The paring knife should be your second purchase, but if budget forces you to choose just one, the chef's knife is essential."
      },
      {
        question: "Are Victorinox knives really as good as $200 German knives?",
        answer: "For performance, yes. The Victorinox cuts identically to premium German knives in blind tests. Same steel quality, same sharpness, same durability. What you don't get: premium handle materials, forged construction, lifetime warranty, luxury brand prestige. The premium is worth it only if you value the luxury experience over pure performance."
      },
      {
        question: "How do I know when I'm ready to add another knife?",
        answer: "You're ready when you find yourself repeatedly wishing you had a specific tool for a task you do at least weekly. Examples: struggling with crusty bread weekly means add the bread knife; breaking down 2+ whole chickens monthly means add the boning knife; cooking for 8+ people regularly means consider the 10-inch chef's knife."
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need different knives for meat vs vegetables?",
        answer: "No. These Victorinox knives are designed for all-purpose use. The same 8-inch chef's knife works perfectly for both dicing onions and slicing chicken breast. Exception: The boning knife is specialized for protein fabrication, but even that's optional unless you're regularly working with bone-in cuts."
