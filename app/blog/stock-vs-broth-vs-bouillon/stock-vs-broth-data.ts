  faq: {
    questions: [
      {
        question: "What's the main difference between stock and broth?",
        answer: "Stock is made from bones (which release gelatin) and is simmered for 4-6 hours to extract maximum collagen and flavor. Broth is made from meat and bones, simmered for 1-2 hours, and is lighter in body. Stock is rich, gelatinous, and used as a base for sauces. Broth is lighter, more seasoned, and used for soups or sipping."
      },
      {
        question: "Is bone broth the same as stock?",
        answer: "Essentially, yes. Bone broth is stock that's been simmered for an extended period (8-24 hours) to extract maximum gelatin, collagen, and minerals. The term 'bone broth' is a modern marketing term for what professional kitchens have always called stock. The main difference is time—bone broth is simmered longer."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I use bouillon instead of stock?",
        answer: "Yes, but the quality is lower. Bouillon (cubes or powder) is dehydrated, concentrated stock or broth mixed with salt, MSG, and flavorings. It's convenient but lacks the body and depth of real stock. Use it when you need something quick, but don't expect the same richness or gelatin content that homemade stock provides."
      },
      {
        question: "Why does my stock not gel when refrigerated?",
        answer: "Not enough gelatin was extracted from the bones. This usually happens if you didn't simmer long enough (need at least 4-6 hours), didn't use enough bones relative to water, or used bones without much connective tissue (like boneless meat). To fix: use more bones, especially knuckles and feet, and simmer longer."
