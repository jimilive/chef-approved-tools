    questions: [
      {
        question: "What's the main difference between stock and broth?",
        answer: "Stock is made from bones (which release gelatin) and is simmered for 4-6 hours to extract maximum collagen and flavor. Broth is made from meat and bones, simmered for 1-2 hours, and is lighter in body. Stock is rich, gelatinous, and used as a base for sauces. Broth is lighter, more seasoned, and used for soups or sipping."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I substitute broth for stock in a recipe?",
        answer: "Yes, for most home cooking. Soups, stews, braising liquids: swap freely. The difference shows up in sauces that reduce. Stock's gelatin gives pan sauces body and gloss. Broth won't. If your recipe reduces the liquid by half or more, use stock. Watch sodium levels on store-bought broth. It's often saltier than stock."
      },
      {
        question: "How long does stock last in the fridge?",
        answer: "Homemade stock: 3-4 days refrigerated, 4-6 months frozen. Store-bought (opened): 4-5 days refrigerated, 2-3 months frozen. Get it cold fast. Don't let stock sit at room temperature longer than 2 hours. Freeze in 1-cup portions using silicone ice cube trays. Pull out what you need without thawing a whole container."
      },
      {
        question: "Is bouillon unhealthy?",
        answer: "Depends what you're worried about. One cube can hit 900-1,100mg of sodium, nearly half your daily limit. Most contain MSG (FDA considers it safe, despite the reputation). Some contain hydrogenated oils. If you're watching blood pressure or prefer whole-food ingredients, bouillon isn't ideal. For occasional use without health concerns, it's fine. Better Than Bouillon paste beats cubes on flavor but has the same sodium issue."
      },
      {
        question: "What's the difference between bone broth and stock?",
        answer: "Marketing. 'Bone broth' is stock rebranded for the wellness crowd. Both come from simmering bones in water to extract collagen. The only real difference: bone broth simmers longer (12-48 hours vs. 4-8 for stock) to pull more gelatin. Professional kitchens have made 'bone broth' for centuries. We called it stock."
      },
      {
        question: "Why doesn't my homemade stock gel?",
        answer: "Five reasons: (1) Not enough collagen-rich parts. Add chicken feet, wings, or joints. (2) Too much water diluting the gelatin. Bones should fill at least half your pot. (3) Boiled too hard. Gentle simmer extracts collagen. Rolling boil breaks it down. (4) Not cooked long enough. Chicken needs 4-6 hours minimum. Beef needs 8-12. (5) Young grocery store birds have less developed connective tissue than older laying hens. Stock that doesn't gel still contains gelatin. It's diluted, not absent."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I use bouillon instead of stock or broth?",
        answer: "For background flavor in rice, beans, or vegetables: yes. For soups where the liquid carries the dish: it'll taste flat. Never use bouillon in sauces that reduce. As liquid evaporates, salt concentrates. A pan sauce made with bouillon becomes inedible by the time it hits proper consistency. Bouillon works as a supporting player, not the star."
      },
      {
        question: "How can I tell if broth has gone bad?",
        answer: "Nose first. Spoiled broth smells sour or wrong. Unmistakably wrong. Visual signs: cloudiness in previously clear broth, surface film, mold. Texture turning slimy or unusually thick. When in doubt, throw it out. Food poisoning isn't worth $3."
      },
      {
        question: "What ratio of bouillon to water should I use?",
        answer: "Standard: 1 cube or 1 teaspoon paste per 1 cup water. For Better Than Bouillon paste, use about 3/4 teaspoon per cup. It's more concentrated. Taste as you go. Bouillon varies by brand. Start with less. You can add more. You can't un-salt soup."
      },
      {
        question: "What is fond and how is it different from stock?",
        answer: "Fond is the French word for stock (literally 'foundation'). You'll hear 'fond de veau' (veal stock) or 'fond de volaille' (chicken stock) in professional kitchens. The word also refers to the browned bits stuck to the pan after searing meat. These caramelized proteins are flavor gold. Deglaze them with stock or wine to make a pan sauce. Same word, related concept: both are foundations for building flavor."
