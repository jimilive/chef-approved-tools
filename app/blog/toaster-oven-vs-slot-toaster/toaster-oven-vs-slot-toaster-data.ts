    introduction: [
      "After 24 years in professional kitchens—where every piece of equipment earns its counter space or gets replaced—I've thought more about toast than most people consider reasonable. At Purple Cafe, we needed consistent, fast toast production for brunch service. At home, I want an appliance that justifies its footprint. These two goals point to different solutions, and understanding the trade-offs helps you pick the right one.",
      "Slot toasters do one thing. Toaster ovens do many things. The question isn't which is better—it's which matches how you actually cook."

    questions: [
      {
        question: "Is a toaster oven more energy efficient than a regular oven?",
        answer: "Yes. Toaster ovens use 1,200-1,800 watts compared to 2,000-5,000 watts for full-size ovens. For small cooking tasks—reheating, baking small batches, or cooking for 1-2 people—a toaster oven significantly reduces energy consumption."
      },
      {
        question: "Can a toaster oven replace a regular toaster?",
        answer: "Technically yes, but with trade-offs. Toaster ovens take longer to produce toast (4-8 minutes vs 2-4) and may produce less consistent browning. If you make toast daily, a dedicated slot toaster delivers better results faster."
      },
      {
        question: "What size toaster oven should I get?",
        answer: "For basic tasks, a 4-slice capacity (fitting a 9-inch pizza) works for most needs. For family cooking or if you'll use it as an oven replacement, look for 6-slice capacity (fitting a 12-inch pizza)."
      },
      {
        question: "Are expensive toasters worth it?",
        answer: "Quality matters more than price. Mid-range toasters often outperform both cheap and premium models. Look for consistent browning, durable construction, and the features you'll actually use."
      },
      {
        question: "Why does my toaster oven toast unevenly?",
        answer: "Uneven toasting usually results from the bread's position relative to heating elements. Place bread in the center of the rack, avoid the edges where heat is less consistent, and experiment with rack positions."
      },
      {
        question: "Should I get both a toaster and toaster oven?",
        answer: "Many households find value in both: a dedicated slot toaster for morning toast and a toaster oven for reheating and small cooking tasks. If counter space is limited, choose based on your primary use case."
