const faqJsonLd = generateFAQSchema([
  {
    question: 'What&apos;s the biggest mistake home cooks make during prep?',
    answer: 'They start cooking before they&apos;ve finished prepping. Always cut, measure, and organize everything first. This is the core principle of mise en place—everything in its place before you turn on the heat. Starting to cook mid-prep creates chaos and forces you to multitask when you should be focused on technique.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do chefs stay so calm during service?',
    answer: 'Mise en place. Every move is planned before the first ticket prints. At home, that same principle makes dinner relaxing instead of frantic. Professional chefs prep everything before service starts—ingredients are measured, tools are in place, and the workflow is planned. That preparation creates the calm you see during service.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I meal prep without fancy containers?',
    answer: 'Absolutely. Just stay consistent—same size, stackable, and labeled. You don&apos;t need restaurant-grade Cambro containers. Any clear, stackable containers work as long as you use them systematically. The key is consistency: same sizes stack better, clear sides let you see contents, and labels prevent guessing games.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How can I train myself to stay clean while cooking?',
    answer: 'Wipe every time you finish a task. It&apos;s muscle memory—five seconds of cleaning saves five minutes later. Professional chefs reset their stations constantly: dice onions, wipe down. Trim chicken, wipe down. This habit keeps your workspace clear and your mind focused. Start with one task at a time, and the habit builds naturally.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Does mise en place save time?',
    answer: 'Yes—dramatically. It turns 60-minute chaos into 30 minutes of smooth cooking. The time you spend prepping and organizing upfront is recovered during cooking because you&apos;re not stopping to chop garlic, search for tools, or clean up messes. Your workflow becomes continuous and efficient instead of fragmented and reactive.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I don&apos;t have enough counter space for a full prep station?',
    answer: 'Use what you have strategically. A cutting board, one bowl for prepped ingredients, and a scrap container are enough to start. You can set up a temporary station on a dining table, a large cutting board over the sink, or even a kitchen cart. The principles of mise en place work in any space—it&apos;s about organization, not square footage.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I organize my prep station if I&apos;m left-handed?',
    answer: 'Reverse the workflow: ingredients on your right, finished prep on your left, waste behind or below. The same principles apply—you just mirror the setup. Professional kitchens accommodate both right- and left-handed cooks by letting each person arrange their station for their dominant hand. Flow matters more than which side things are on.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I prep everything at once or in stages throughout the week?',
    answer: 'It depends on what you&apos;re cooking and how much time you have. Batch prep works well for grains, roasted vegetables, and proteins that hold for 3-4 days. Delicate items like fresh herbs and cut fruit should be prepped closer to use. A hybrid approach—prep sturdy items in batches, fresh items daily—balances efficiency with quality.'

        <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
          <p>
            When I was in culinary school, one of my instructors barked a line that stuck with me for life:
          </p>

          <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-orange-600 pl-6 italic text-slate-700 my-6">
            &quot;Look at your station! It&apos;s a mess! When your station is like that, it means your mind is too!&quot;
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            He wasn&apos;t wrong. Every professional chef learns that mise en place — everything in its place — is more than organization. It&apos;s mindset, discipline, and calm in the chaos.
          </p>

          <p>
            At home, the same principle transforms your kitchen. You don&apos;t need stainless counters or speed racks; you just need flow, awareness, and the right tools in the right places. This guide shows you how to build restaurant efficiency into your home meal prep — so cooking feels effortless, not overwhelming.

            The Power of Mise en Place
          </h2>

          <p>
            In restaurants, mise en place isn&apos;t optional — it&apos;s survival. It&apos;s the quiet system that keeps service running when tickets stack and the grill&apos;s on fire.
          </p>

          <p>
            At home, it&apos;s the difference between calm, confident cooking and mid-recipe panic. You know the feeling — halfway through, you&apos;re missing the garlic, the cutting board&apos;s buried under scraps, and you&apos;re frantically stirring sauce with the wrong spoon.
          </p>

          <p>
            A clean, intentional station fixes all of that.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mise en place means everything has a home. Every knife, towel, and container lives in a logical place. You always know where things are — and that mental clarity makes cooking flow.
          </p>

          <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-600 p-6 my-8">
            <p className="font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-2">What Mise en Place Solves:</p>
            <ul className="space-y-2 mb-0">
              <li><strong>Mid-recipe scrambling:</strong> Everything&apos;s prepped before you start cooking</li>
              <li><strong>Cluttered workspace:</strong> Tools and ingredients have designated spots</li>
              <li><strong>Wasted time:</strong> No searching for utensils or ingredients mid-task</li>

            Setting Up Your Prep Station
          </h2>

          <p>
            A good prep station is about zones — not square footage. You can apply this to a kitchen counter, a cart, or even a dining table if space is tight.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">
            Step 1: Clear the Decks
          </h3>

          <p>
            Start fresh every time. Clear your counter completely. Wipe it down, dry it, and build your station from zero.
          </p>

          <p>
            Professional kitchens don&apos;t start service with clutter. Neither should you. A clean surface creates mental clarity and physical space to work efficiently.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">
            Step 2: Define Zones
          </h3>

          <p>
            A proper station has three key areas:
          </p>

          <div className="bg-slate-50 border border-slate-200 rounded-lg p-6 my-8">
            <ul className="space-y-4 mb-0">
              <li>
                <strong className="text-slate-900">Knife Zone:</strong> Cutting board, chef&apos;s knife, paring knife, towel.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="text-slate-900">Prep Zone:</strong> Bowls, ingredients, seasoning, oil.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="text-slate-900">Waste Zone:</strong> Scrap container or compost bowl, tucked to one side.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>
            Keep your cutting board front and center — it&apos;s your &quot;stage.&quot; Everything else orbits around it.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">
            Step 3: Keep a Towel Handy
          </h3>

          <p>
            Every chef keeps a folded side towel under their board hand. It&apos;s not decoration — it&apos;s control. Wipe knife edges, grip hot handles, and stabilize cutting boards instantly.
          </p>

          <p>
            In professional kitchens, you&apos;ll see cooks with a towel tucked into their apron strings or draped over their shoulder. That towel gets used dozens of times per shift — for wiping, gripping, and cleaning as you go.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-12 mb-6">
            Organizing for Flow
          </h2>

          <p>
            In pro kitchens, flow is everything. You move from left to right, clean to dirty, raw to cooked. This keeps the workspace safe, efficient, and predictable.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">
            Create a Logical Workflow
          </h3>

          <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-600 p-6 my-8">
            <ul className="space-y-2 mb-0">
              <li>Place ingredients on your left if you&apos;re right-handed (reverse if left-handed).</li>
              <li>Keep finished components or containers on your right.</li>
              <li>Trash or compost goes behind or below, never on the board.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>
            This left-to-right flow mimics how you read and how your hands naturally move. Ingredients flow from raw (left) through the cutting board (center) to finished prep (right). It&apos;s intuitive once you establish the pattern.
          </p>

            Labeling and Storage
          </h2>

          <p>
            Restaurant prep walks a fine line between chaos and perfection. Labeling is what keeps it balanced.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">
            Use the 3-Part Label
          </h3>

          <p>
            In kitchens, every container gets a label with:
          </p>

          <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 my-6">
            <li>Item name</li>
            <li>Date made</li>
            <li>Chef or initials</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            At home, skip the initials but keep the name and date. You&apos;ll never wonder if that sauce is from yesterday or last week.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">
            Smart Storage Tips
          </h3>

          <div className="bg-slate-50 border border-slate-200 rounded-lg p-6 my-8">
            <ul className="space-y-3 mb-0">
              <li>Use clear containers so you can see what&apos;s inside.</li>
              <li>Stack by category: sauces, proteins, produce.</li>
              <li>Keep a &quot;use first&quot; section for older items — first in, first out.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>
            <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Use masking tape and a Sharpie. Cheap, fast, and infinitely effective. You can peel off the tape when the container empties and reuse it immediately.

            Resetting Like a Pro
          </h2>

          <p>
            Culinary school drills one habit harder than any recipe: reset your station constantly.
          </p>

          <p>
            Every prep task — dice onions, reset. Trim chicken, reset. That five-second wipe and reorganize keeps your brain clean, not just your counter.
          </p>

          <p>
            In restaurant kitchens, resets happen automatically. You&apos;ll hear a chef yell &quot;clean down!&quot; between orders. It&apos;s both command and meditation.
          </p>

          <p>
            At home, think of it like hitting &quot;save&quot; while writing — the longer you go without, the more chaos you risk losing.
          </p>

          <div className="bg-purple-50 border-l-4 border-purple-600 p-6 my-8">
            <p className="font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">End-of-Day Reset:</p>

            Putting It All Together
          </h2>

          <p>
            Mise en place isn&apos;t a checklist — it&apos;s a mindset. When your station is organized, your cooking becomes calm and intentional. You stop reacting to chaos and start controlling the process.
          </p>

          <p>
            Start small. Set up one clean station before your next meal. Clear the counter, define your zones, keep a towel handy, and reset between tasks. That&apos;s it. The efficiency builds from there.
          </p>

          <p>
            Professional chefs don&apos;t cook faster because they&apos;re more talented — they cook faster because they&apos;re more organized. Mise en place creates that organization, and organization creates speed.

                What&apos;s the biggest mistake home cooks make during prep?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                They start cooking before they&apos;ve finished prepping. Always cut, measure, and organize everything first. This is the core principle of mise en place—everything in its place before you turn on the heat. Starting to cook mid-prep creates chaos and forces you to multitask when you should be focused on technique.

                How do chefs stay so calm during service?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                Mise en place. Every move is planned before the first ticket prints. At home, that same principle makes dinner relaxing instead of frantic. Professional chefs prep everything before service starts—ingredients are measured, tools are in place, and the workflow is planned. That preparation creates the calm you see during service.
              </p>

                Can I meal prep without fancy containers?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                Absolutely. Just stay consistent—same size, stackable, and labeled. You don&apos;t need restaurant-grade Cambro containers. Any clear, stackable containers work as long as you use them systematically. The key is consistency: same sizes stack better, clear sides let you see contents, and labels prevent guessing games.

              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                Wipe every time you finish a task. It&apos;s muscle memory—five seconds of cleaning saves five minutes later. Professional chefs reset their stations constantly: dice onions, wipe down. Trim chicken, wipe down. This habit keeps your workspace clear and your mind focused. Start with one task at a time, and the habit builds naturally.

                Does mise en place save time?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                Yes—dramatically. It turns 60-minute chaos into 30 minutes of smooth cooking. The time you spend prepping and organizing upfront is recovered during cooking because you&apos;re not stopping to chop garlic, search for tools, or clean up messes. Your workflow becomes continuous and efficient instead of fragmented and reactive.

                What if I don&apos;t have enough counter space for a full prep station?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                Use what you have strategically. A cutting board, one bowl for prepped ingredients, and a scrap container are enough to start. You can set up a temporary station on a dining table, a large cutting board over the sink, or even a kitchen cart. The principles of mise en place work in any space—it&apos;s about organization, not square footage.

                How do I organize my prep station if I&apos;m left-handed?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                Reverse the workflow: ingredients on your right, finished prep on your left, waste behind or below. The same principles apply—you just mirror the setup. Professional kitchens accommodate both right- and left-handed cooks by letting each person arrange their station for their dominant hand. Flow matters more than which side things are on.

                Should I prep everything at once or in stages throughout the week?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                It depends on what you&apos;re cooking and how much time you have. Batch prep works well for grains, roasted vegetables, and proteins that hold for 3-4 days. Delicate items like fresh herbs and cut fruit should be prepped closer to use. A hybrid approach—prep sturdy items in batches, fresh items daily—balances efficiency with quality.
