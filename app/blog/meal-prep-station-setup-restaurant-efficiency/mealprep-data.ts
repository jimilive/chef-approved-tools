      {
        question: "What's the biggest mistake home cooks make during prep?",
        answer: "They start cooking before they've finished prepping. Always cut, measure, and organize everything first. This is the core principle of mise en place—everything in its place before you turn on the heat. Starting to cook mid-prep creates chaos and forces you to multitask when you should be focused on technique."
      },
      {
        question: "How do chefs stay so calm during service?",
        answer: "Mise en place. Every move is planned before the first ticket prints. At home, that same principle makes dinner relaxing instead of frantic. Professional chefs prep everything before service starts—ingredients are measured, tools are in place, and the workflow is planned. That preparation creates the calm you see during service."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I meal prep without fancy containers?",
        answer: "Absolutely. Just stay consistent—same size, stackable, and labeled. You don't need restaurant-grade Cambro containers. Any clear, stackable containers work as long as you use them systematically. The key is consistency: same sizes stack better, clear sides let you see contents, and labels prevent guessing games."
      },
      {
        question: "How can I train myself to stay clean while cooking?",
        answer: "Wipe every time you finish a task. It's muscle memory—five seconds of cleaning saves five minutes later. Professional chefs reset their stations constantly: dice onions, wipe down. Trim chicken, wipe down. This habit keeps your workspace clear and your mind focused. Start with one task at a time, and the habit builds naturally."
      },
      {
        question: "Does mise en place save time?",
        answer: "Yes—dramatically. It turns 60-minute chaos into 30 minutes of smooth cooking. The time you spend prepping and organizing upfront is recovered during cooking because you're not stopping to chop garlic, search for tools, or clean up messes. Your workflow becomes continuous and efficient instead of fragmented and reactive."
      },
      {
        question: "What if I don't have enough counter space for a full prep station?",
        answer: "Use what you have strategically. A cutting board, one bowl for prepped ingredients, and a scrap container are enough to start. You can set up a temporary station on a dining table, a large cutting board over the sink, or even a kitchen cart. The principles of mise en place work in any space—it's about organization, not square footage."
      },
      {
        question: "How do I organize my prep station if I'm left-handed?",
        answer: "Reverse the workflow: ingredients on your right, finished prep on your left, waste behind or below. The same principles apply—you just mirror the setup. Professional kitchens accommodate both right- and left-handed cooks by letting each person arrange their station for their dominant hand. Flow matters more than which side things are on."
      },
      {
        question: "Should I prep everything at once or in stages throughout the week?",
        answer: "It depends on what you're cooking and how much time you have. Batch prep works well for grains, roasted vegetables, and proteins that hold for 3-4 days. Delicate items like fresh herbs and cut fruit should be prepped closer to use. A hybrid approach—prep sturdy items in batches, fresh items daily—balances efficiency with quality."
