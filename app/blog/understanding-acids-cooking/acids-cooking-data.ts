        content: "One of my chefs had a brutal but effective quality test. He'd taste every sauce, soup, and composed dish before it went to the line. If it lacked brightness, he'd squeeze a lemon wedge over it and taste again. **\"See the difference?\"** he'd ask. **\"That's what's missing. Fix it.\"** Nine times out of ten, what was \"missing\" was acid. The dish had salt, fat, and good ingredients, but no acid to tie it all together and make flavors pop. A squeeze of lemon or a splash of vinegar was the difference between \"good\" and \"send it out.\" He taught every cook on the line: **Taste. Adjust. Taste again. If it's still flat, add acid.** **The lesson:** Acid isn't optional. It's fundamental to balanced flavor, just like salt."

        "After 24 years of cooking professionally, I can tell you this: **If your food tastes flat, you probably need acid**.",
        "Salt enhances. Fat carries. Acid brightens and balances. Together, they create the complete flavor profile that makes restaurant food taste so good.",
        "The next time you cook, keep lemon wedges or a bottle of good vinegar nearby. Taste your dish before serving. If it's missing something, if it tastes rich but flat, add a small amount of acid. Taste again. You'll immediately understand why this is one of the most important techniques in professional cooking.",

    questions: [
      {
        question: "What's the best acid for finishing dishes?",
        answer: "Lemon juice is the most versatile. It brightens without adding competing flavors. For richer dishes, red wine vinegar adds depth. For Asian cuisine, rice vinegar or lime juice. For delicate dishes, champagne vinegar or white wine vinegar. The key is matching acid intensity to dish richness."
      },
      {
        question: "Can you add too much acid?",
        answer: "Yes. Too much acid makes food sour and unpleasant, and can overpower other flavors. Add acid gradually (a squeeze of lemon at a time), tasting between additions. You can always add more; you can't take it back."
      },
      {
        question: "When should I add acid during cooking?",
        answer: "It depends. For brightness and balance, add acid at the end (last 30 seconds to 2 minutes). For tenderizing or flavor development during cooking, add early. For vinaigrettes and marinades, acid goes in at the start. For finishing sauces, add at the very end off heat to preserve bright flavor."
