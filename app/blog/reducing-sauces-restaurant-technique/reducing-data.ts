        question: "Can I fix an over-reduced sauce?",
        answer: "Yes, add a splash of stock or water to thin it back to balance. Over-reduced sauces become too salty, too thick, or too intense. Add liquid gradually, tasting as you go, until the flavor and consistency return to balance. The sauce may need a few minutes of gentle simmering to reintegrate the added liquid."
      },
      {
        question: "Why does my sauce taste metallic?",
        answer: "Usually from acidic reductions in aluminum pans. Stick to stainless or enameled cookware. Aluminum reacts with acids (wine, tomatoes, vinegar) and can impart a metallic or off flavor. Stainless steel, enameled cast iron, or copper-lined pans are non-reactive and preserve the true flavor of your reduction."
      },
      {
        question: "What's the difference between reducing and thickening?",
        answer: "Reduction removes water to intensify flavor; thickening adds starch or fat to change texture. Reduction concentrates everything in the liquid (sugars, acids, proteins) creating depth. Thickening with cornstarch, flour, or cream changes consistency but doesn't concentrate flavor. Professional sauces use reduction for flavor, then thicken only if needed."
      },
      {
        question: "How long should I reduce a sauce?",
        answer: "Depends on volume: 20 minutes for light reductions, up to 90 for demi-glace. A pan sauce from deglazing might reduce in 5-10 minutes. A full stock reduction for demi-glace can take 1-2 hours. Volume, pan size, and heat level all affect timing. Judge by consistency and taste, not the clock."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I store reduced sauces?",
        answer: "Yes, refrigerate up to 5 days or freeze up to 3 months. Store reduced sauces in airtight containers. They'll thicken further when chilled; gently reheat with a splash of stock or water to restore the original consistency. Reduced sauces are concentrated flavor bombs, perfect for quick weeknight meals."

      {
        question: "What does nappe consistency mean?",
        answer: "Nappe is the French term for when sauce coats the back of a spoon and leaves a clean trail when you drag your finger through it. This is the classic test for proper reduction. The sauce should cling to the spoon without being gloppy or running off immediately. It's the perfect balance between too thin and too thick."
      },
      {
        question: "Should I reduce with the lid on or off?",
        answer: "Always off. Covering the pan traps steam and prevents evaporation, the whole point of reduction. You want water to escape, concentrating the flavors left behind. A lid turns reduction into simmering, which doesn't change the liquid's composition. Keep it uncovered and watch the magic happen."
      },
      {
        question: "Why is my reduced sauce cloudy instead of clear?",
        answer: "You didn't skim enough during reduction. As sauce simmers, proteins, fats, and impurities rise to the surface. If you don't skim them off, they emulsify back into the sauce, creating cloudiness. Skim every few minutes with a ladle or spoon for crystal-clear, professional results. Clarity equals clean flavor."
