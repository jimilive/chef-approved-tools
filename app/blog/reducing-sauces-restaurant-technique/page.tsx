const faqJsonLd = generateFAQSchema([
  {
    question: 'Can I fix an over-reduced sauce?',
    answer: 'Yes—add a splash of stock or water to thin it back to balance. Over-reduced sauces become too salty, too thick, or too intense. Add liquid gradually, tasting as you go, until the flavor and consistency return to balance. The sauce may need a few minutes of gentle simmering to reintegrate the added liquid.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Why does my sauce taste metallic?',
    answer: 'Usually from acidic reductions in aluminum pans—stick to stainless or enameled cookware. Aluminum reacts with acids (wine, tomatoes, vinegar) and can impart a metallic or off flavor. Stainless steel, enameled cast iron, or copper-lined pans are non-reactive and preserve the true flavor of your reduction.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What&apos;s the difference between reducing and thickening?',
    answer: 'Reduction removes water to intensify flavor; thickening adds starch or fat to change texture. Reduction concentrates everything in the liquid—sugars, acids, proteins—creating depth. Thickening with cornstarch, flour, or cream changes consistency but doesn&apos;t concentrate flavor. Professional sauces use reduction for flavor, then thicken only if needed.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long should I reduce a sauce?',
    answer: 'Depends on volume—20 minutes for light reductions, up to 90 for demi-glace. A pan sauce from deglazing might reduce in 5-10 minutes. A full stock reduction for demi-glace can take 1-2 hours. Volume, pan size, and heat level all affect timing. Judge by consistency and taste, not the clock.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I store reduced sauces?',
    answer: 'Yes—refrigerate up to 5 days or freeze up to 3 months. Store reduced sauces in airtight containers. They&apos;ll thicken further when chilled; gently reheat with a splash of stock or water to restore the original consistency. Reduced sauces are concentrated flavor bombs—perfect for quick weeknight meals.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What does nappe consistency mean?',
    answer: 'Nappe is the French term for when sauce coats the back of a spoon and leaves a clean trail when you drag your finger through it. This is the classic test for proper reduction. The sauce should cling to the spoon without being gloppy or running off immediately. It&apos;s the perfect balance between too thin and too thick.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I reduce with the lid on or off?',
    answer: 'Always off. Covering the pan traps steam and prevents evaporation—the whole point of reduction. You want water to escape, concentrating the flavors left behind. A lid turns reduction into simmering, which doesn&apos;t change the liquid&apos;s composition. Keep it uncovered and watch the magic happen.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Why is my reduced sauce cloudy instead of clear?',
    answer: 'You didn&apos;t skim enough during reduction. As sauce simmers, proteins, fats, and impurities rise to the surface. If you don&apos;t skim them off, they emulsify back into the sauce, creating cloudiness. Skim every few minutes with a ladle or spoon for crystal-clear, professional results. Clarity equals clean flavor.'

            If there&apos;s one sound that tells a chef things are going right, it&apos;s that gentle, confident simmer of a sauce reducing on the stove. Not boiling, not splattering — just a calm <em>blip... blip... blip</em> as the liquid thickens, aromas deepen, and the flavor builds toward perfection.
          </p>

          <p>
            Reduction is one of those techniques that separates home cooking from restaurant cooking. It&apos;s simple in theory — just simmer until thicker — but the details make all the difference. Temperature, timing, and taste control determine whether you end up with a silky, glossy glaze or a scorched, sticky mess.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let&apos;s go deep on the method every restaurant uses daily — the one that turns good into unforgettable.

            The Purpose of Reduction
          </h2>

          <p>
            Every reduction has one goal: intensify flavor through evaporation.
          </p>

          <p>
            By slowly cooking off water, you&apos;re concentrating everything that remains — sugars, fats, proteins, acids, and aromas. Done right, reduction turns thin stock into glossy demi-glace, watery pan drippings into a rich jus, or simple wine into velvet sauce.
          </p>

          <p>
            The key word here is <em>slowly</em>. When you rush reduction, you don&apos;t just lose water — you lose balance. Sweet becomes bitter, savory turns salty, and acid goes harsh.
          </p>

          <p>
            In short: heat makes flavor louder; time makes it beautiful.
          </p>

            <p className="font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">What Reduction Accomplishes:</p>
            <ul className="space-y-2 mb-0">
              <li><strong>Concentrates flavor:</strong> Removes water, leaving behind pure essence</li>
              <li><strong>Improves texture:</strong> Creates body and viscosity without starch</li>
              <li><strong>Deepens color:</strong> Caramelization intensifies during reduction</li>
              <li><strong>Balances elements:</strong> Controlled reduction harmonizes sweet, salty, and acidic notes</li>

            <Thermometer className="w-8 h-8 text-orange-600" />
            The Science of Concentration
          </h2>

          <p>
            When a liquid simmers, water molecules escape as vapor, leaving behind the heavier compounds that give food flavor and texture.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each stage of reduction changes the sauce&apos;s behavior:
          </p>

          <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-600 p-6 my-8">
            <ul className="space-y-2 mb-0">
              <li><strong>Early (thin stage):</strong> Gentle simmering releases steam, color still light.</li>
              <li><strong>Middle (coating stage):</strong> Viscosity increases, bubbles slow down.</li>
              <li><strong>Final (nappe stage):</strong> Sauce coats the back of a spoon and leaves a clean line when you drag your finger through it.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>
            The more you reduce, the less forgiving the sauce becomes. At the end, a few seconds can mean the difference between silk and sludge.
          </p>

            The Professional Reduction Method
          </h2>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">
            Step 1: Start with the Right Base
          </h3>

          <p>
            Great reductions start with flavor. If you begin with watery broth, you&apos;ll just end up with less watery broth. Use homemade stock, pan drippings, or a sauce already rich in gelatin.
          </p>

            <p className="mb-0">
              Avoid store-bought &quot;broths&quot; with added salt — you&apos;ll over-reduce and end up with a salt bomb.

          </div>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">
            Step 2: Choose the Right Pan
          </h3>

          <p>
            A wide, shallow pan exposes more surface area for evaporation.
          </p>

            Step 3: Medium Heat, Gentle Simmer
          </h3>

          <p>
            Bring the liquid just to a simmer — small, lazy bubbles. Never full boil. Boiling agitates the sauce, clouds it, and risks scorching.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">
            Step 4½: Skim, Skim, Skim
          </h3>

          <p>
            Every few minutes, impurities, proteins, and fat rise to the top. If you don&apos;t skim them off, they emulsify back in and cloud your sauce.
          </p>

          <p>
            Use a ladle or small spoon, and don&apos;t rush it. This step is what separates a restaurant-level reduction from a greasy home version.
          </p>

          <p>
            Keep your eye on the surface — the cleaner you keep it, the purer and brighter your final flavor will be.

            When the sauce coats the back of a spoon and a finger swipe leaves a clean trail — that&apos;s <em>nappe</em>, the French test for perfection.

            The right pan makes all the difference. Wide, shallow pans like sauciers and skillets maximize surface area, speeding evaporation and creating even, controlled reduction.

            Final Thoughts
          </h2>

          <p>
            Reduction is the soul of professional sauce-making. It&apos;s where patience meets precision, where time transforms simple liquids into complex, layered flavor.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once you understand reduction—once you learn to listen to the simmer, watch the bubbles, and taste the balance—you&apos;ll never look at sauce the same way. You&apos;ll build them instinctively, adjusting heat and timing by feel.
          </p>

          <p>
            That&apos;s the professional approach: control the process, trust the technique, and let the flavor speak for itself.
          </p>

                Can I fix an over-reduced sauce?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                Yes—add a splash of stock or water to thin it back to balance. Over-reduced sauces become too salty, too thick, or too intense. Add liquid gradually, tasting as you go, until the flavor and consistency return to balance. The sauce may need a few minutes of gentle simmering to reintegrate the added liquid.
              </p>
            </div>

                Why does my sauce taste metallic?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                Usually from acidic reductions in aluminum pans—stick to stainless or enameled cookware. Aluminum reacts with acids (wine, tomatoes, vinegar) and can impart a metallic or off flavor. Stainless steel, enameled cast iron, or copper-lined pans are non-reactive and preserve the true flavor of your reduction.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-2">
                What&apos;s the difference between reducing and thickening?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                Reduction removes water to intensify flavor; thickening adds starch or fat to change texture. Reduction concentrates everything in the liquid—sugars, acids, proteins—creating depth. Thickening with cornstarch, flour, or cream changes consistency but doesn&apos;t concentrate flavor. Professional sauces use reduction for flavor, then thicken only if needed.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-2">
                How long should I reduce a sauce?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                Depends on volume—20 minutes for light reductions, up to 90 for demi-glace. A pan sauce from deglazing might reduce in 5-10 minutes. A full stock reduction for demi-glace can take 1-2 hours. Volume, pan size, and heat level all affect timing. Judge by consistency and taste, not the clock.
              </p>

                Can I store reduced sauces?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                Yes—refrigerate up to 5 days or freeze up to 3 months. Store reduced sauces in airtight containers. They&apos;ll thicken further when chilled; gently reheat with a splash of stock or water to restore the original consistency. Reduced sauces are concentrated flavor bombs—perfect for quick weeknight meals.

                What does nappe consistency mean?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                Nappe is the French term for when sauce coats the back of a spoon and leaves a clean trail when you drag your finger through it. This is the classic test for proper reduction. The sauce should cling to the spoon without being gloppy or running off immediately. It&apos;s the perfect balance between too thin and too thick.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-2">
                Should I reduce with the lid on or off?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                Always off. Covering the pan traps steam and prevents evaporation—the whole point of reduction. You want water to escape, concentrating the flavors left behind. A lid turns reduction into simmering, which doesn&apos;t change the liquid&apos;s composition. Keep it uncovered and watch the magic happen.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-2">
                Why is my reduced sauce cloudy instead of clear?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                You didn&apos;t skim enough during reduction. As sauce simmers, proteins, fats, and impurities rise to the surface. If you don&apos;t skim them off, they emulsify back into the sauce, creating cloudiness. Skim every few minutes with a ladle or spoon for crystal-clear, professional results. Clarity equals clean flavor.
