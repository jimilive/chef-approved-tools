        question: "Do I really need to understand science to cook well?",
        answer: "No, you can follow recipes successfully without understanding the science. But understanding science transforms you from a recipe-follower into a confident, adaptable cook who knows why techniques work and can troubleshoot when things go wrong. It's the difference between memorizing steps and actually understanding cooking."
      },
      {
        question: "Isn't cooking science too complicated for home cooks?",
        answer: "Not at all. You don't need to memorize chemical formulas or equations. You just need to understand basic principles like 'heat causes proteins to coagulate,' 'fat carries flavor,' and 'acids brighten dishes.' These concepts are intuitive once explained in plain language."
      },
      {
        question: "What's the most important cooking science principle to learn first?",
        answer: "The Maillard reaction. Understanding that browning = flavor and that it requires high heat and dry surfaces will immediately improve 80% of your savory cooking. Start there."
