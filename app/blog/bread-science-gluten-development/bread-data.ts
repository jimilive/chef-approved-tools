        question: "What is gluten and why does it matter in bread?",
        answer: "Gluten is a protein network that forms when two proteins in wheat flour (glutenin and gliadin) bond together in the presence of water and mechanical action (kneading). This network traps gas produced by yeast, allowing bread to rise and giving it structure and chewiness. Without gluten development, bread would be dense, crumbly, and flat."
      },
      {
        question: "How do I know when I've kneaded dough enough?",
        answer: "Use the windowpane test: Take a small piece of dough and gently stretch it. If it stretches thin enough to see light through it without tearing, the gluten is fully developed. If it tears immediately, keep kneading. Most doughs need 8-10 minutes of hand kneading or 5-7 minutes in a stand mixer."
      },
      {
        question: "Can you over-knead bread dough?",
        answer: "Yes, but it's rare when kneading by hand. Over-kneaded dough becomes tight, tears easily, and produces dense bread. This usually only happens with prolonged machine kneading (15+ minutes in a stand mixer). Signs: the dough feels dry, tears when stretched, and doesn't spring back when poked."
      },
      {
        question: "Why does no-knead bread work if gluten needs mechanical action?",
        answer: "Time replaces mechanical action. In no-knead recipes, gluten develops slowly through autolysis. Enzymes in the flour break down proteins, and the gluten network forms naturally over 12-18 hours. The long fermentation also develops complex flavor. No-knead bread trades speed for convenience and flavor."
