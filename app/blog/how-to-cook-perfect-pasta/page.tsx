  {
    question: "Should I add oil to the pasta water?",
    answer: "No. Oil floats on top and does nothing to prevent sticking. Proper water amount and occasional stirring prevent sticking. Oil actually makes sauce slide off pasta."
  },
  {
    question: "How much pasta per person?",
    answer: "2 oz dried pasta per person as a side, 4 oz as a main course. That's 1/4 pound for 2 people as main course."
  },
  {
    question: "Why does restaurant pasta taste better than mine?",
    answer: "Three reasons: (1) They salt the water properly, (2) They finish pasta in the sauce with pasta water, (3) They add fat at the end. Follow those three steps and yours will taste restaurant-quality."

              Restaurant Reality
            </p>
            <p className="text-blue-100 mb-0 leading-relaxed">
              At Il Pizzaiolo in Seattle, we cooked hundreds of pounds of pasta every service. Fresh pasta from the cooler, dried pasta from bulk bins—all of it had to be perfect al dente, finished in sauce, and plated in under 3 minutes. I watched new line cooks massacre pasta daily: undercooked and crunchy, overcooked and mushy, undersalted and bland, or worst of all—rinsed under cold water (never, ever do this). The difference between amateur pasta and professional pasta isn&apos;t expensive ingredients—it&apos;s understanding water ratios, salt levels, timing, and how to finish pasta properly. Today I&apos;m teaching you the exact technique that creates restaurant-quality pasta every single time.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            Most people think cooking pasta is foolproof—boil water, add pasta, drain when soft. Then they wonder why their pasta tastes bland, sticks together, or has sauce that won&apos;t cling.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Cooking pasta correctly requires understanding four critical factors:</strong> water quantity, salt level, timing, and finishing technique. Get these right and your pasta will rival any Italian restaurant. Get them wrong and even expensive imported pasta tastes mediocre.
          </p>

            <Droplet className="w-6 h-6 text-orange-600" />
            The Four Fundamentals of Perfect Pasta
          </h2>

          <h3>1. Water Quantity: More Than You Think</h3>

          <p>
            <strong>The rule:</strong> 4-6 quarts water per pound of pasta
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Why it matters:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Too little water = temperature drops dramatically when pasta added, cooking slows</li>
            <li>Crowded pasta = sticks together, cooks unevenly</li>
            <li>Starch concentration too high in small amounts of water = gummy pasta</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>Minimum:</strong> 4 quarts per pound<br />
            <strong>Better:</strong> 6 quarts per pound (what restaurants use)<br />
            <strong>Home cooking:</strong> For 8oz pasta (2 servings), use 3-4 quarts minimum
          </p>

          <h3>2. Salt Level: More Than You&apos;d Ever Guess</h3>

          <p>
            <strong>The rule:</strong> 1-2 tablespoons kosher salt per 4 quarts water
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Tastes like:</strong> Ocean water (actually seawater is 3.5% salt, pasta water should be 1-2%)
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Why it matters:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Pasta absorbs water during cooking</li>
            <li>Unsalted water = unsalted pasta</li>
            <li>Salt added to sauce later doesn&apos;t penetrate pasta—it&apos;s too late</li>
          </ul>

          <div className="bg-amber-50 border-l-4 border-amber-400 p-6 my-8 rounded-r-lg">
            <p className="font-bold text-slate-900 mb-2 flex items-center gap-2">
              <AlertTriangle className="w-5 h-5 text-amber-600" />
              The Pasta Water Rule
            </p>
            <p className="mb-0">
              ALWAYS save at least 1 cup of pasta cooking water before draining. This starchy, salted water is liquid gold for making sauce cling to pasta and adjusting consistency. Professional chefs use it in every single pasta dish. Home cooks throw it away. Don&apos;t throw it away.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>3. Timing: Trust the Pasta, Not the Box</h3>

          <p>
            Package times are guidelines, not gospel. They vary by altitude, water hardness, pot size, and heat level.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>The only way to know:</strong> Taste it
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>When to start tasting:</strong> 2 minutes before package minimum time
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>What you&apos;re looking for:</strong> Al dente—slight resistance when you bite, but no raw flour taste in center
          </p>

          <h3>4. Finishing: Never Rinse, Always Marry</h3>

          <p>
            <strong>The cardinal sin:</strong> Rinsing pasta after cooking
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Why never rinse:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Rinses away starch that helps sauce cling</li>
            <li>Cools pasta instantly</li>
            <li>Makes sauce slide right off</li>
            <li>Completely ruins texture</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>What to do instead:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Drain pasta (save 1-2 cups pasta water)</li>
            <li>Add immediately to hot sauce in pan</li>
            <li>Toss vigorously with pasta water to emulsify</li>
            <li>&quot;Marry&quot; pasta and sauce over heat for 1-2 minutes</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Step-by-Step: The Professional Method</h2>

          <h3>Step 1: Use the Right Pot</h3>

          <p>
            <strong>Size:</strong> 6-8 quart pot for 1 pound pasta<br />
            <strong>Material:</strong> Any material works (stainless, aluminum, even nonstick)<br />
            <strong>Shape:</strong> Tall and narrow better than short and wide
          </p>

          <h3>Step 2: Bring Water to Rolling Boil</h3>

          <p>
            <strong>How much:</strong> 4-6 quarts for 1 pound pasta<br />
            <strong>Rolling boil:</strong> Large, vigorous bubbles constantly breaking surface<br />
            <strong>Time:</strong> 10-15 minutes depending on pot size
          </p>

          <h3>Step 3: Salt Generously</h3>

          <p>
            <strong>How much:</strong> 1-2 tablespoons kosher salt per 4 quarts water<br />
            <strong>When:</strong> After water reaches full boil, before adding pasta<br />
            <strong>Taste it:</strong> Water should taste like seawater—clearly, noticeably salty
          </p>

          <h3>Step 4: Add Pasta</h3>

          <p>
            <strong>How:</strong> Add all at once (for long pasta, let ends soften 10 seconds, then push down)<br />
            <strong>Stir immediately:</strong> Within 30 seconds to prevent sticking<br />
            <strong>Don&apos;t add oil:</strong> Myth—oil floats on top and does nothing
          </p>

          <h3>Step 5: Taste for Doneness</h3>

          <p>
            <strong>Start tasting:</strong> 2 minutes before package minimum time<br />
            <strong>What you&apos;re looking for:</strong> Slight firmness when you bite, cooked through but with pleasant resistance<br />
            <strong>Continue tasting:</strong> Every 30-60 seconds until perfect
          </p>

          <h3>Step 6: Reserve Pasta Water</h3>

          <p>
            <strong>How much:</strong> 1-2 cups (use coffee mug or measuring cup)<br />
            <strong>When:</strong> Immediately before draining<br />
            <strong>Why:</strong> This is non-negotiable. You&apos;ll need it to finish the dish.
          </p>

          <h3>Step 7: Drain (Don&apos;t Rinse!)</h3>

          <p>
            Pour into colander, shake gently. Work quickly—pasta shouldn&apos;t cool. Have your sauce ready in the pan before draining.
          </p>

          <h3>Step 8: Finish in Sauce</h3>

          <p>
            <strong>The professional technique:</strong>
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Drain pasta (don&apos;t rinse)</li>
            <li>Add pasta to hot sauce in sauté pan</li>
            <li>Add 1/4-1/2 cup pasta water</li>
            <li>Toss vigorously over medium-high heat for 1-2 minutes</li>
            <li>Sauce should coat pasta, not pool at bottom</li>
            <li>Add more pasta water if too thick</li>
            <li>Finish with fat (butter, olive oil, Parmesan)</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            <strong>Why this works:</strong> Pasta absorbs sauce flavor, starch from pasta water emulsifies sauce, everything heats together, and sauce and pasta &quot;marry&quot; instead of just sitting next to each other.
          </p>

          <h2>The Bottom Line: Technique Over Ingredients</h2>

          <p>
            After cooking thousands of pounds of pasta in restaurants over 24 years, here&apos;s what I want home cooks to understand:
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Perfect pasta has nothing to do with expensive imported brands and everything to do with proper technique.</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Even mediocre boxed pasta tastes incredible when cooked correctly. Even the finest Italian pasta tastes bland when undercooked, undersalted, or poorly finished.
          </p>

          <p>
            The non-negotiable rules:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Enough water</strong> (4-6 quarts per pound)</li>
            <li><strong>Properly salted</strong> (1-2 tbsp per 4 quarts—taste it)</li>
            <li><strong>Tested for doneness</strong> (start 2 min before package time)</li>
            <li><strong>Never rinsed</strong> (destroys everything)</li>
            <li><strong>Finished in sauce</strong> with pasta water (this is what makes it restaurant-quality)</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            Follow those five rules and your pasta will rival any Italian restaurant. Skip any of them and you&apos;re leaving quality on the table.
          </p>

          <p>
            Stop cooking pasta like you&apos;re making kraft dinner and start finishing it like a professional.
          </p>
