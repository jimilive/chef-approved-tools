      {
        question: "Can I start with cheaper tools?",
        answer: "Yes, but buy the best version of the basic tool you can afford. Reliability matters more than brand names. A $50 Victorinox chef's knife will outperform a $15 supermarket knife every time—and it's still affordable. The key is avoiding tools that will fail quickly or require immediate replacement."
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need specialty pans or knives?",
        answer: "Not yet. Master your chef's knife and one great pan before expanding. Once you're comfortable with these basics and understand how they work, you'll know exactly what specialty tools you actually need based on what you cook most often."
      },
      {
        question: "What should I buy next after these five tools?",
        answer: "After these five essentials, add: a pair of spring-loaded tongs for flipping and turning, a balloon whisk for sauces and vinaigrettes, and a heavy stainless saucepan (3-quart) for soups and grains. These three round out your core toolkit without adding clutter."
      },
      {
        question: "Why not start with a knife block set?",
        answer: "Knife block sets look impressive but contain many knives you'll rarely use. A steak knife set, boning knife, and specialized tools sit unused while adding cost. One excellent chef's knife handles 90% of kitchen tasks. Add a paring knife and serrated bread knife later only if you find you need them."
      },
      {
        question: "Is cast iron really better than nonstick for beginners?",
        answer: "Yes, because cast iron teaches you proper heat management and pan technique while lasting decades. Nonstick pans wear out in 1-3 years with normal use, and they can't achieve the high heat needed for proper searing. Cast iron requires some learning but makes you a better cook."
      },
      {
        question: "How much should I budget for all five tools?",
        answer: "You can build this entire starter kit for $150-200 with quality tools: Victorinox knife ($40), large cutting board ($25-40), Lodge cast iron skillet ($25-35), instant-read thermometer ($20-100 depending on speed), and bench scraper ($10-15). This setup will last years with proper care."
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need different cutting boards for different foods?",
        answer: "Not essential at first, but helpful as you expand. Start with one large board for general use. If you process a lot of raw meat, adding a dedicated plastic board for proteins reduces cross-contamination risk. Always wash thoroughly between uses regardless of material."
      },
      {
        question: "What's the biggest mistake new cooks make with kitchen tools?",
        answer: "Buying gadgets before mastering basics. Home cooks often purchase egg slicers, garlic presses, and avocado tools before they own a decent chef's knife. These single-use tools create clutter and don't improve your cooking. Focus on versatile, multi-purpose tools that build fundamental skills."
