const faqJsonLd = generateFAQSchema([
  {
    question: 'Can I store knives in their boxes?',
    answer: 'Sure, short term—but boxes trap moisture. Fine for collectors, not for daily use. If you have specialty knives you use occasionally, box storage protects the edges but requires thorough drying first. For everyday knives, you need quick access and proper air circulation to prevent rust and corrosion.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do magnetic strips affect blade steel?',
    answer: 'No. High-carbon or stainless steel won\'t be magnetized enough to matter. The magnetic field from a knife strip isn\'t strong enough to alter the steel\'s molecular structure or affect edge retention. Even after years on a magnetic strip, your knives will perform exactly as they would with any other storage method.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I mount a magnetic strip safely?',
    answer: 'Into studs or anchors rated for 15+ lbs. You don\'t want a chef\'s knife falling at 2 a.m. Use a stud finder to locate wall studs, then mount the strip with screws into solid wood. If mounting to drywall, use heavy-duty toggle anchors or molly bolts. Test the installation by hanging your heaviest knife and giving it a firm tug before loading the entire strip.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What\'s best for kids\' safety?',
    answer: 'Drawer inserts with child-safety locks or high-mounted magnetic strips. Never leave knives out on low strips within reach. In-drawer storage with a locking mechanism is the safest option for homes with young children. Alternatively, mount magnetic strips 5+ feet high where small hands can\'t reach, and teach older children proper knife respect early.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Why does my knife block smell musty?',
    answer: 'Trapped moisture and food particles create bacteria growth inside the slots. Knife blocks are nearly impossible to clean thoroughly. To remedy: remove all knives, turn the block upside down and shake out debris, vacuum the slots, then sanitize with a 1:10 vinegar-water solution. Let it dry completely for 48 hours before reinserting knives. Better yet, switch to a more hygienic storage method.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use a magnetic strip for serrated knives?',
    answer: 'Yes, as long as you place the flat spine against the magnet, not the serrated edge. Serrated knives work fine on magnetic strips, but be mindful of the teeth—don\'t drag them across the magnet. Pull sideways to remove, keeping the serrations away from contact. Most bread knives and steak knives store safely this way.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How many knives can a magnetic strip hold?',
    answer: 'Most 16-18 inch strips hold 5-8 knives depending on blade width. A standard home kitchen strip comfortably holds a chef\'s knife, paring knife, bread knife, utility knife, and a couple of specialty blades. If you have more knives, install multiple strips or choose a longer 24-inch model. Never overcrowd—knives should have space between them.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What\'s the best storage for expensive Japanese knives?',
    answer: 'Magnetic strips with wood or cork facing, or individual knife guards in a drawer. High-carbon Japanese steel is more prone to chipping than German steel, so gentle storage is critical. Wood-backed magnetic strips (like walnut or bamboo) cushion the blade better than bare metal. For ultimate protection, use plastic edge guards and store in a felt-lined drawer.'

            I&apos;ve seen it all—knife blocks crusted with years of dust, magnetic strips hanging dangerously close to stoves, and drawers that might as well be knife graveyards.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I managed kitchens at Mellow Mushroom in the late &apos;90s, every cook had their own method. One guy kept his knives in a leather roll, another used a strip above the prep table, and one poor soul jammed his chef&apos;s knife into the utensil drawer (that didn&apos;t last long).
          </p>

          <p>
            By the end of this guide, you&apos;ll know which knife storage method actually preserves your blades, protects your hands, and keeps your knives ready to work—not just sit on display.

            The Problem: Why Knife Storage Matters More Than You Think
          </h2>

          <p>
            Most home cooks don&apos;t realize that how you store your knives can shorten their life by years. Every time blades bump against metal or wood, edges deform microscopically—eventually becoming dull, chipped, or bent.
          </p>

          <p>
            Knife blocks seem safe, but they trap moisture and food particles deep inside, turning into a breeding ground for bacteria. Magnetic strips solve that problem, but they can scratch knives if you yank them off the wrong way. Drawer inserts are tidy, but a bad fit can still dull your knives faster than cutting through cardboard.
          </p>

          <p>
            In a professional kitchen, every knife has a purpose and a home. We store them in a roll or hang them on the wall, never tossed into a drawer or buried in a block. It&apos;s about respect—for your tools and your fingers.
          </p>

            <ul className="space-y-2 mb-0">
              <li><strong>Microscopic edge damage:</strong> Every contact point dulls the blade incrementally</li>

            The Professional Method: Choosing the Right Storage for You

            1. Knife Block: Classic, but Flawed
          </h3>

          <p>
            A good wooden block looks tidy and keeps knives accessible. The downside? You can&apos;t clean the slots properly, and repeated contact dulls your blades.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you insist on using one, insert knives edge up (to prevent scraping). This means the spine sits in the slot, not the sharp edge. Most people do this backward and wonder why their knives dull so quickly.
          </p>

          <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-600 p-6 my-8">
            <p className="font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-2">Knife Block Pros:</p>
            <ul className="space-y-1 mb-3">
              <li>• Countertop storage—no wall mounting required</li>
              <li>• Organized and visually tidy</li>
              <li>• Protects edges from contact with other knives</li>
              <li>• Often comes bundled with knife sets</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-2 mt-4">Knife Block Cons:</p>
            <ul className="space-y-1 mb-0">
              <li>• Impossible to clean thoroughly—traps bacteria and debris</li>
              <li>• Repeated insertion dulls edges if not done spine-first</li>
              <li>• Takes up valuable counter space</li>
              <li>• Moisture gets trapped in slots, promoting rust</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>
            <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Never store knives wet. Even stainless steel corrodes when moisture is trapped. Always dry thoroughly before inserting into the block.
          </p>

            2. Magnetic Strip: Professional Favorite
          </h3>

          <p>
            This is my go-to at home. Mount it away from the stove and sink. Always pull knives sideways, not straight off, so the edge doesn&apos;t catch. Use a strong neodymium strip that grips securely even with heavy chef&apos;s knives.
          </p>

          <p>
            The key is technique: place the spine against the magnet first, then let the blade settle. When removing, slide the knife sideways along the strip before pulling away. This prevents the edge from scraping against the magnet or adjacent knives.
          </p>

          <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-600 p-6 my-8">
            <p className="font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-2">Magnetic Strip Pros:</p>
            <ul className="space-y-1 mb-3">
              <li>• No contact with blade edges—preserves sharpness</li>
              <li>• Easy to clean—wipe with a damp cloth</li>
              <li>• Air circulation prevents moisture buildup</li>
              <li>• Saves counter space</li>
              <li>• Displays your knives beautifully</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-2 mt-4">Magnetic Strip Cons:</p>
            <ul className="space-y-1 mb-0">
              <li>• Requires wall mounting—not renter-friendly in all cases</li>
              <li>• Knives are exposed—not ideal with young children</li>
              <li>• Cheap strips can scratch blades or lose magnetism</li>
              <li>• Improper removal can chip edges</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>
            <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Stainless steel or wood-covered strips are safest; avoid cheap painted ones—they chip and rust.

            3. Drawer Insert: Safe for Kids and Small Kitchens
          </h3>

          <p>
            If you have limited space or curious little hands around, a bamboo drawer insert is a great option. Choose one with deep slots and felt or soft wood lining.
          </p>

          <p>
            The best inserts keep each knife in its own compartment, preventing blade-to-blade contact. Look for models with angled slots that let you see knife handles at a glance—this prevents the dangerous game of &quot;grab and hope it&apos;s the right knife.&quot;
          </p>

          <div className="bg-purple-50 border-l-4 border-purple-600 p-6 my-8">
            <p className="font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-2">Drawer Insert Pros:</p>
            <ul className="space-y-1 mb-3">
              <li>• Hidden storage—safest for homes with children</li>
              <li>• Protects knife edges from contact</li>
              <li>• Organizes knives by size and type</li>
              <li>• No counter or wall space required</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-2 mt-4">Drawer Insert Cons:</p>
            <ul className="space-y-1 mb-0">
              <li>• Requires a dedicated drawer with adequate depth</li>
              <li>• Less convenient—you have to open a drawer every time</li>
              <li>• Poor-quality inserts still allow blade contact</li>
              <li>• Can shift around if drawer isn&apos;t a perfect fit</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>
            <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Keep knives separated—blades should never touch each other. If your insert allows contact, it&apos;s not doing its job.

            4. Knife Roll: For Serious Cooks
          </h3>

          <p>
            If you travel, cater, or just want to protect your investment, use a professional knife roll. Mine from culinary school (1994) is still kicking. Heavy canvas or leather keeps blades from rubbing together.
          </p>

          <p>
            Professional knife rolls have individual pockets for each knife, padded dividers, and reinforced stitching. They&apos;re designed to withstand daily use in high-pressure environments where dropping your roll could mean broken tips and lost service time.

            Common Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)
          </h2>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">
            Mistake #1: Storing Wet Knives
          </h3>

          <p>
            Moisture + enclosed space = rust and bacteria. Always dry knives thoroughly before storage—especially high-carbon steel, which rusts faster than stainless.
          </p>

          <p>
            Use a clean towel to dry the entire blade, including the area where the blade meets the handle. Water trapped in that joint causes hidden corrosion that weakens the knife over time.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">
            Mistake #2: Jamming Knives into Blocks
          </h3>

          <p>
            If you hear wood scraping steel, you&apos;re dulling your edge. Always insert gently or store spine down, not edge down.
          </p>

          <p>
            The force required to jam a knife into a tight slot is enough to bend the edge microscopically. Over months, this creates a rolled edge that no amount of honing can fix—you&apos;ll need a full resharpening.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">
            Mistake #3: Using Weak Magnets
          </h3>

          <p>
            A strip that can&apos;t hold a cleaver is dangerous. If it slips, you&apos;re risking more than a dull edge—you&apos;re risking a trip to the ER.
          </p>

          <p>
            Test your magnetic strip by hanging your heaviest knife and giving it a firm sideways tug. If it budges, the magnet isn&apos;t strong enough. Replace it before you load it with sharp blades.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">
            Mistake #4: Tossing Knives in Drawers
          </h3>

          <p>
            Every bump chips your blade. A drawer insert solves this, but only if knives never touch. Loose storage is a recipe for dull knives and cut fingers.
          </p>

          <p>
            I&apos;ve seen knife edges chipped beyond repair from months in a junk drawer. One cook at Mellow Mushroom brought in a &quot;new&quot; knife that looked like it had been through a blender. Turned out he&apos;d been storing it next to metal spatulas and tongs for six months.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">
            Mistake #5: Mounting Strips in the Wrong Location
          </h3>

          <p>
            Never mount magnetic strips directly above the stove (heat damages magnetism) or near the sink (water splashes cause rust). Choose a dry, cool wall section at comfortable arm height.
          </p>

            Final Thoughts
          </h2>

          <p>
            The best knife storage method is the one you&apos;ll actually use consistently. If you&apos;re a home cook who values convenience and knife longevity, a magnetic strip is hard to beat. If you have kids, a locked drawer insert gives you peace of mind. If you&apos;re already invested in a knife block, at least use it correctly—spine down, dried thoroughly.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whatever method you choose, remember: your knives are tools, not decorations. Store them in a way that protects their edges, keeps them accessible, and respects the investment you made in quality steel.

                Can I store knives in their boxes?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                Sure, short term—but boxes trap moisture. Fine for collectors, not for daily use. If you have specialty knives you use occasionally, box storage protects the edges but requires thorough drying first. For everyday knives, you need quick access and proper air circulation to prevent rust and corrosion.

                Do magnetic strips affect blade steel?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                No. High-carbon or stainless steel won&apos;t be magnetized enough to matter. The magnetic field from a knife strip isn&apos;t strong enough to alter the steel&apos;s molecular structure or affect edge retention. Even after years on a magnetic strip, your knives will perform exactly as they would with any other storage method.

              <p className="text-slate-700">
                Into studs or anchors rated for 15+ lbs. You don&apos;t want a chef&apos;s knife falling at 2 a.m. Use a stud finder to locate wall studs, then mount the strip with screws into solid wood. If mounting to drywall, use heavy-duty toggle anchors or molly bolts. Test the installation by hanging your heaviest knife and giving it a firm tug before loading the entire strip.

              <p className="text-slate-700">
                Drawer inserts with child-safety locks or high-mounted magnetic strips. Never leave knives out on low strips within reach. In-drawer storage with a locking mechanism is the safest option for homes with young children. Alternatively, mount magnetic strips 5+ feet high where small hands can&apos;t reach, and teach older children proper knife respect early.

              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                Trapped moisture and food particles create bacteria growth inside the slots. Knife blocks are nearly impossible to clean thoroughly. To remedy: remove all knives, turn the block upside down and shake out debris, vacuum the slots, then sanitize with a 1:10 vinegar-water solution. Let it dry completely for 48 hours before reinserting knives. Better yet, switch to a more hygienic storage method.

                Can I use a magnetic strip for serrated knives?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                Yes, as long as you place the flat spine against the magnet, not the serrated edge. Serrated knives work fine on magnetic strips, but be mindful of the teeth—don&apos;t drag them across the magnet. Pull sideways to remove, keeping the serrations away from contact. Most bread knives and steak knives store safely this way.

              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                Most 16-18 inch strips hold 5-8 knives depending on blade width. A standard home kitchen strip comfortably holds a chef&apos;s knife, paring knife, bread knife, utility knife, and a couple of specialty blades. If you have more knives, install multiple strips or choose a longer 24-inch model. Never overcrowd—knives should have space between them.

                What&apos;s the best storage for expensive Japanese knives?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                Magnetic strips with wood or cork facing, or individual knife guards in a drawer. High-carbon Japanese steel is more prone to chipping than German steel, so gentle storage is critical. Wood-backed magnetic strips (like walnut or bamboo) cushion the blade better than bare metal. For ultimate protection, use plastic edge guards and store in a felt-lined drawer.
