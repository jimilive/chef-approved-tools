Many santoku knives feature a granton edge—hollowed dimples along the blade that create air pockets, helping food release cleanly.",

    questions: [
      {
        question: "Is a santoku knife better than a chef knife?",
        answer: "Neither is universally better—they're designed for different cutting techniques. A chef knife excels at rocking cuts and mincing. A santoku knife is faster for straight up-and-down vegetable prep. Most professional kitchens use both."
      },
      {
        question: "Should I get a santoku knife or chef's knife first?",
        answer: "Start with a chef's knife. It handles 80% of kitchen tasks competently. Add a santoku knife later when you find yourself doing heavy vegetable prep and wanting thinner, more precise slices."
      },
      {
        question: "Can a santoku replace a chef's knife?",
        answer: "For some cooks, yes. If you primarily cook vegetables and Asian-inspired dishes, a santoku could be your primary knife. However, for mincing herbs, breaking down proteins, and general versatility, a chef's knife is harder to replace."
      },
      {
        question: "Why are santoku knives so popular?",
        answer: "Santoku knives are lighter, less intimidating than large chef's knives, and excel at the vegetable prep that dominates home cooking. The flatter blade is also more intuitive for cooks who didn't grow up using the rocking technique."
      },
      {
        question: "What does santoku mean?",
        answer: "Santoku translates to 'three virtues' in Japanese, referring to the knife's ability to handle three tasks: slicing, dicing, and mincing. Some interpret it as the three foods it handles well: meat, fish, and vegetables."
      },
      {
        question: "Is santoku Japanese or German?",
        answer: "Santoku is a Japanese knife style. However, German manufacturers like Wusthof and Henckels now make santoku-style knives, often with Western-style handles and slightly different steel compositions."
      },
      {
        question: "Which knife is better for beginners?",
        answer: "A chef's knife is typically better for beginners because it's more forgiving and versatile. The curved blade and softer steel handle mistakes better than a santoku's harder, more acute edge."
      }
