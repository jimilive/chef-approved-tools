  {
    question: "What's the best potato for mashing?",
    answer: "Russets or Yukon Golds. Russets create the fluffiest, lightest mash. Yukon Golds create a creamier, buttery mash. Avoid red potatoes or new potatoes—they're too waxy and turn gluey when mashed."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use any potato for fries?",
    answer: "No. Russets (high-starch) make the best fries—crispy outside, fluffy inside. Yukon Golds work but won't get as crispy. Red potatoes or fingerlings will be disappointing—they don't have enough starch for proper crisping."
  },
  {
    question: "Why do my roasted potatoes turn mushy?",
    answer: "Either you're overcrowding the pan (creating steam instead of roasting), using too much oil, or not roasting hot enough. Use high heat (425-450°F), give potatoes space, and use just enough oil to coat. Also, choose the right potato—waxy potatoes hold shape better than starchy ones for roasting."

            Potatoes are the most versatile vegetable in the kitchen. You can fry them, roast them, boil them, mash them, bake them, grill them, or turn them into soup. But here&apos;s the thing most home cooks don&apos;t know: <strong>the type of potato you choose matters just as much as the cooking method</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            I learned this lesson early in culinary school. Our instructor handed us five different potato varieties and told us to make french fries from each one. Same temperature, same technique, same everything—except the potato. The results were wildly different. Russets made perfect, crispy fries. Yukon Golds turned golden and delicious but softer. Red potatoes? Disaster. They fell apart, turned mushy, and wouldn&apos;t crisp no matter what we did.
          </p>

          <p>
            That day taught me that <strong>choosing the right potato for the job is non-negotiable</strong>. Use the wrong variety and you&apos;ll fight your ingredients all day. Use the right one and potatoes become effortless.
          </p>

            Understanding Potato Starch Content
          </h2>

          <p>
            Before we talk about varieties, you need to understand what makes potatoes different from each other: <strong>starch content</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Potatoes are classified into three categories based on their starch level:
          </p>

          <h3>High-Starch Potatoes (Starchy)</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Starch content:</strong> 18-22%<br />
            <strong>Texture:</strong> Dry, fluffy, mealy<br />
            <strong>Holds shape when cooked:</strong> No—they fall apart easily
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Best for:</strong> Baking, mashing, frying, any application where you want a fluffy interior
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Examples:</strong> Russet (Idaho), Russet Burbank
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Why they work:</strong> High starch means low moisture. When you cook these potatoes, the starch granules absorb water and swell, creating a light, fluffy texture. The dry exterior also crisps beautifully when fried or roasted. But that same quality means they fall apart when boiled—don&apos;t use them for potato salad.
          </p>

          <h3>Medium-Starch Potatoes (All-Purpose)</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Starch content:</strong> 15-18%<br />
            <strong>Texture:</strong> Creamy, slightly waxy<br />
            <strong>Holds shape when cooked:</strong> Moderately
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Best for:</strong> Roasting, mashing, grilling, versatile applications
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Examples:</strong> Yukon Gold, Yellow Finn, Purple Peruvian
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Why they work:</strong> Medium-starch potatoes hit the sweet spot—enough starch for creaminess, enough moisture to hold together. They&apos;re genuinely all-purpose. You can roast them for crispy edges and creamy centers, mash them for rich texture, or boil them for potato salad. They&apos;re the workhorse potatoes in most restaurant kitchens.
          </p>

          <h3>Low-Starch Potatoes (Waxy)</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Starch content:</strong> 12-16%<br />
            <strong>Texture:</strong> Firm, moist, waxy<br />
            <strong>Holds shape when cooked:</strong> Yes—they stay intact even when boiled
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Best for:</strong> Boiling, potato salad, roasting (where you want intact pieces), gratins, soups
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Examples:</strong> Red potatoes (Red Bliss, Red Norland), fingerlings, new potatoes
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Why they work:</strong> Low starch means high moisture and low breakdown. These potatoes hold their shape beautifully, making them perfect for dishes where you need distinct pieces—potato salad, roasted baby potatoes, soups, gratins. They don&apos;t mash well (too gluey) and they don&apos;t fry as crispy as high-starch varieties, but for what they do, they&apos;re unbeatable.
          </p>

              Restaurant Reality: The Potato Station
            </p>
            <p className="mb-0">
              At Mellow Mushroom, we went through 50-pound bags of potatoes every single day. We had three varieties on hand at all times: Russets for baking and fries, Yukon Golds for mashing and roasting, and red potatoes for salads and side dishes. New cooks would try to substitute one for another—mashing red potatoes, making fries from Yukon Golds, using russets in potato salad—and every time, the result was wrong. <strong>The lesson:</strong> Potatoes aren&apos;t interchangeable. Each variety has a specific job, and using the wrong one means you&apos;re fighting the ingredient. Once I learned to match the potato to the method, everything became easier. Crispy fries every time. Creamy mash without glueyness. Potato salad that held together instead of falling apart. The secret isn&apos;t technique—it&apos;s using the right potato for the job.

          <h2>The Bottom Line: Match the Potato to the Method</h2>

          <p>
            After 24 years of cooking professionally, I can tell you this: <strong>The right potato makes cooking effortless. The wrong potato makes it impossible</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Remember:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Russets</strong> - Baking, mashing, frying (fluffy, crispy)</li>
            <li><strong>Yukon Golds</strong> - All-purpose, roasting, mashing (creamy, versatile)</li>
            <li><strong>Red/Fingerlings</strong> - Boiling, salads, soups (holds shape)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Choose wisely, and potatoes will never let you down.
