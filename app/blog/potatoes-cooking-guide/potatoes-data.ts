        question: "What's the best potato for mashing?",
        answer: "Russets or Yukon Golds. Russets create the fluffiest, lightest mash. Yukon Golds create a creamier, buttery mash. Avoid red potatoes or new potatoes. They're too waxy and turn gluey when mashed."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I use any potato for fries?",
        answer: "No. Russets (high-starch) make the best fries: crispy outside, fluffy inside. Yukon Golds work but won't get as crispy. Red potatoes or fingerlings will be disappointing. They don't have enough starch for proper crisping."
      },
      {
        question: "Why do my roasted potatoes turn mushy?",
        answer: "Either you're overcrowding the pan (creating steam instead of roasting), using too much oil, or not roasting hot enough. Use high heat (425-450°F), give potatoes space, and use just enough oil to coat. Also, choose the right potato. Waxy potatoes hold shape better than starchy ones for roasting."
