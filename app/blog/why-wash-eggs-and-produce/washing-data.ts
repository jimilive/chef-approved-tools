        question: "Should I wash eggs before storing them in the refrigerator?",
        answer: "No, never wash eggs before storage. Washing removes their natural protective coating (cuticle), making the porous shells more vulnerable to bacterial penetration. Store eggs unwashed in the refrigerator, then wash individual eggs under warm running water immediately before cracking them."

        question: "Do I need to wash pre-washed salad greens?",
        answer: "Yes, pre-washed packaged salads still benefit from washing. Studies show that pre-washed greens still contain detectable bacteria, and once packaging opens, contamination increases from exposure to air and handling. Give them a quick rinse before eating for added safety."

        question: "Is it safe to use soap or dish detergent when washing produce?",
        answer: "No, never wash produce with soap, dish detergent, or other cleaning products. These substances are not approved for food contact and can leave harmful residues. Porous produce absorbs soap, creating potential health risks. Plain cold running water combined with rubbing or scrubbing provides adequate cleaning."

        question: "How should I wash berries without damaging them?",
        answer: "Place berries in a colander and rinse under gentle cold running water. Shake gently to remove excess water, then spread on a clean towel to air dry. Critical timing: wash berries immediately before eating, never before storage. Moisture promotes mold growth, so unwashed berries stored in their original container last significantly longer."

        question: "Why is it important to wash melons before cutting them?",
        answer: "Melon rinds carry particularly dangerous contamination because cutting through an unwashed rind transfers surface bacteria directly into the edible flesh. Cantaloupes pose especially high Salmonella risk due to their netted texture that traps bacteria. Multiple foodborne illness outbreaks have been traced to unwashed melons. Always scrub melons thoroughly with a brush under running water before cutting."

        question: "Does washing produce remove all pesticides?",
        answer: "Washing removes approximately 75-80% of pesticide residues from produce surfaces, but not all. While regulatory limits keep residues within safe ranges, washing provides additional protection, particularly important for children and pregnant women who face higher vulnerability to chemical exposure. For maximum reduction, combine washing with peeling when practical."
