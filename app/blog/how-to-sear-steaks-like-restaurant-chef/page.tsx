            {
              question: "How hot should my pan be for searing steak?",
              answer: "Your pan should reach 400-450°F for optimal searing. The Maillard reaction—which creates that beautiful brown crust—starts at 300°F and ramps up quickly around 350°F. At Purple Café, we preheated cast iron pans for 5-7 minutes over medium-high heat until a drop of water instantly vaporized. If you can't hold your hand over the pan for more than 2-3 seconds, it's ready."
            },
            {
              question: "What is the Maillard reaction and why does it matter?",
              answer: "The Maillard reaction is a chemical reaction between amino acids and sugars that creates the flavorful brown crust on seared meat. It occurs between 300-400°F and produces hundreds of flavor compounds that make restaurant-quality steaks taste so good. This is different from caramelization—the Maillard reaction involves proteins, not just sugars."
            },
            {
              question: "Why does my steak stick to the pan?",
              answer: "Sticking is normal at first—steaks will naturally stick to the pan initially, then release when a proper crust forms. The main causes of excessive sticking are: pan not hot enough, wet steak surface, or moving the steak too early. Pat steaks completely dry, preheat the pan to 400-450°F, and don't touch the steak for 3-4 minutes. When the crust is ready, it releases naturally."
            },
            {
              question: "Why is my steak turning grey instead of brown?",
              answer: "Grey steak means you're steaming, not searing. Common causes: moisture on the steak surface (always pat bone-dry with paper towels), pan not hot enough (preheat 5-7 minutes), or overcrowding the pan (which drops temperature). Moisture creates steam, and steam prevents the Maillard reaction. One steak per 10-inch pan maximum."
            },
            {
              question: "Should I use oil or butter for searing steak?",
              answer: "Use high smoke-point oil for searing—refined avocado oil (520°F), ghee (480°F), or safflower oil work best. Butter's smoke point is only 350°F, so it burns at proper searing temperatures. The professional technique: sear in high smoke-point oil, then add butter in the last minute for basting. You get the high-heat sear without burning."
            },
            {
              question: "What's the best oil for high-heat steak searing?",
              answer: "Refined avocado oil (smoke point 520°F) or ghee/clarified butter (480°F) are ideal for searing. At Purple Café during 200+ cover nights, we used clarified butter because it combines high smoke point with rich flavor. Avoid extra virgin olive oil (320°F smoke point) and regular butter (350°F)—both burn and create acrid flavors at searing temperatures."
            },
            {
              question: "How do I know when to flip my steak?",
              answer: "Wait 3-4 minutes without moving the steak, then check the edge—when you see a brown crust climbing about ⅓ up the side, it's ready to flip. The steak will release easily from the pan when the crust is properly formed. Flipping too early tears the developing crust and creates grey, steamed meat instead of a proper sear."
            },
            {
              question: "Should I season steak before or after searing?",
              answer: "Season generously with kosher salt immediately before searing—within 3 minutes of hitting the pan. Salt draws out moisture, so salting too early (10-30 minutes before) creates surface wetness that prevents browning. Professional kitchens salt right before searing, or at least 45 minutes ahead (dry brining). The 10-40 minute window is the worst time."
            },
            {
              question: "Why is there so much smoke when I sear steak?",
              answer: "Smoke is normal and expected when searing at proper temperatures (400-450°F). At Purple Café, we ran exhaust fans on high during service because proper searing produces smoke. If there's no smoke, your pan isn't hot enough for the Maillard reaction. Minimize smoke by using minimal oil (or oil the steak directly instead of the pan) and ensuring good ventilation."
            },
            {
              question: "Can I sear steak in a stainless steel pan instead of cast iron?",
              answer: "Yes—stainless steel works excellently for searing if it's heavy-gauge. Cast iron retains heat better when you add cold meat, but stainless steel heats more evenly and is easier to deglaze for pan sauces. At Purple Café, we used both. The key is a heavy pan (thin pans lose heat instantly) preheated for 5-7 minutes until screaming hot."

              The Restaurant Reality
            </h3>
            <p className="text-orange-800 mb-0">
              In a busy restaurant, we don&apos;t have time for second chances. Every steak needs a perfect sear on the first try,
              whether it&apos;s the 10th or 200th steak of the night. The techniques I&apos;m sharing aren&apos;t just theory—they&apos;re
              battle-tested methods that work under pressure.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2>Why Most Home Cooks Fail at Searing</h2>

          <p>
            I see the same mistakes every time someone tells me they can&apos;t get a good sear at home:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Pan isn&apos;t hot enough</strong> - They&apos;re afraid of high heat</li>
            <li><strong>Steak is too wet</strong> - Moisture is the enemy of browning</li>
            <li><strong>Moving the steak too much</strong> - Impatience ruins the Maillard reaction</li>
            <li><strong>Wrong equipment</strong> - Thin pans can&apos;t handle restaurant-level heat</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            These aren&apos;t just home cook problems—I&apos;ve trained plenty of new line cooks who made the exact same mistakes.
            The difference is learning the fundamentals that create consistent results.
          </p>

          <h2>The Professional Searing Method</h2>

          <h3>Step 1: Equipment That Actually Works</h3>

          <p>
            Restaurant kitchens use heavy-duty equipment because it works. You don&apos;t need commercial gear,
            but you do need tools that can handle high heat without warping or losing temperature.
          </p>

          <div className="bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200 rounded-xl p-6 my-6">
            <h4 className="font-bold text-blue-800 mb-3">Essential Equipment for Perfect Sears</h4>
            <ul className="text-blue-700 space-y-2 mb-4">
              <li><strong>Cast iron skillet or heavy stainless steel pan</strong> - Holds heat like restaurant equipment</li>
              <li><strong>Instant-read thermometer</strong> - Eliminates guesswork on doneness</li>
              <li><strong>Paper towels</strong> - Critical for drying the steak</li>
              <li><strong>Tongs (not a fork)</strong> - Prevents piercing and juice loss</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-sm text-blue-600">

              that we relied on in the restaurant. They distribute heat evenly and develop amazing fond.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>Step 2: Steak Preparation (The Make-or-Break Step)</h3>

          <p>
            This is where most people lose the battle before they even start cooking. In restaurants, we prep steaks
            hours in advance because proper preparation is non-negotiable.
          </p>

          <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 my-6">
            <div className="bg-green-50 border border-green-200 rounded-lg p-4">
              <h4 className="font-bold text-green-800 mb-2">Temperature</h4>
              <p className="text-green-700 text-sm">
                Remove from fridge 30-45 minutes before cooking. Cold steak = uneven cooking.
                Room temperature steak cooks evenly throughout.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="bg-yellow-50 border border-yellow-200 rounded-lg p-4">
              <h4 className="font-bold text-yellow-800 mb-2">Drying</h4>
              <p className="text-yellow-700 text-sm">
                Pat completely dry with paper towels. Any surface moisture will steam instead of sear.
                This is the #1 mistake I see.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>
            <strong>Seasoning timing matters:</strong> Salt the steak either at least 30 minutes before cooking or immediately before cooking.
            Avoid the 5-30 minute window, which draws out moisture without sufficient time for reabsorption.
          </p>

          <h3>Step 3: Heat Management (The Restaurant Secret)</h3>

          <p>
            Here&apos;s what separates restaurant sears from home attempts: we use aggressive heat and aren&apos;t afraid of it.
            Our gas burners run much hotter than most home stoves, but you can compensate with technique.
          </p>

          <div className="bg-red-50 border border-red-200 rounded-xl p-6 my-6">
            <h4 className="font-bold text-red-800 mb-3 flex items-center gap-2">
              <ThermometerSun className="w-5 h-5" />
              Professional Heat Levels
            </h4>
            <ul className="text-red-700 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Preheat cast iron for 5-7 minutes</strong> on medium-high to high heat</li>
              <li><strong>Test with water drop</strong> - should sizzle and evaporate immediately</li>
              <li><strong>Add oil only when pan is hot</strong> - prevents sticking and smoking</li>
              <li><strong>Oil should shimmer, not smoke</strong> - use high smoke point oils (avocado, grapeseed)</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h3>Step 4: The Sear (Don&apos;t Touch It!)</h3>

          <p>
            This is where patience pays off. In a busy restaurant kitchen, you learn to trust the process because
            you don&apos;t have time to babysit every steak.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>Place steak in pan and don&apos;t move it</strong> - 3-4 minutes for 1-inch thick steaks</li>
            <li><strong>Listen for the sizzle</strong> - should be immediate and continuous</li>
            <li><strong>Look for browning around edges</strong> - this tells you when to flip</li>
            <li><strong>Flip once</strong> - multiple flips prevent proper crust formation</li>
            <li><strong>Sear second side</strong> - usually 2-3 minutes less than first side</li>
          </ol>

          <div className="bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-xl p-6 my-6">

              Always use thermometer for accuracy - timing varies with stove power and pan thickness.

          </div>

          <h3>Step 5: The Rest (Just as Important as the Sear)</h3>

          <p>
            After thousands of steaks, I can tell you that resting isn&apos;t optional—it&apos;s what makes the difference
            between good and great. Restaurants build resting time into service because it&apos;s that critical.
          </p>

          <div className="bg-yellow-50 border border-yellow-200 rounded-xl p-6 my-6">
            <h4 className="font-bold text-yellow-800 mb-3">Professional Butter Resting Technique</h4>
            <p className="text-yellow-700 mb-3">
              Here&apos;s a restaurant secret most home cooks never learn: rest your steak on a small pat of butter
              in a warm (but not hot) place for 10-15 minutes. This technique:
            </p>
            <ul className="text-yellow-700 space-y-1 text-sm">
              <li>• Allows even heat distribution throughout the meat</li>
              <li>• Keeps the steak at optimal serving temperature</li>
              <li>• Adds rich flavor without overpowering the beef</li>
              <li>• Creates a more tender, evenly cooked result</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-yellow-600 text-xs mt-3">
              <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Use the residual heat from your oven (turned off) or a warming drawer if you have one.
              The key is warm, not hot—you don&apos;t want to continue cooking the steak.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p><strong>Standard resting basics:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Rest for 10-15 minutes</strong> after cooking (longer with the butter technique)</li>
            <li><strong>Find a warm spot</strong> - turned-off oven, warming drawer, or warm spot near the stove</li>
            <li><strong>Internal temperature will rise 5-10°F</strong> during resting</li>
            <li><strong>Juices redistribute</strong> throughout the meat instead of running out when cut</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Step 6: Professional Pan Sauce (Restaurant Secret)</h3>

          <p>
            Here&apos;s where you can really show off restaurant technique. That beautiful fond (browned bits) in your pan
            is liquid gold for making sauce, and the resting liquid from your butter-rested steak is the perfect deglazing liquid.
          </p>

          <div className="bg-green-50 border border-green-200 rounded-xl p-6 my-6">
            <h4 className="font-bold text-green-800 mb-3">Simple Pan Sauce Technique</h4>

          <h2>The Equipment That Makes a Difference</h2>

          <p>
            You don&apos;t need a $3,000 commercial range, but having the right tools makes consistent results much easier.
            Here&apos;s what I actually use at home after testing countless options in restaurant kitchens:

          <h2>Final Thoughts: Consistency Over Perfection</h2>

          <p>
            The goal isn&apos;t to nail the perfect steak once—it&apos;s to cook great steaks consistently. That&apos;s what
            separates restaurant cooking from home cooking. We use systems and techniques that work every time, not just
            when everything goes perfectly.
          </p>

          <p>
            Start with these fundamentals: proper equipment, room temperature steak, aggressive heat, patience during the sear,
            and adequate resting. Master these basics, and you&apos;ll be cooking restaurant-quality steaks at home.

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">How hot should my pan be for searing steak?</h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                Your pan should reach 400-450°F for optimal searing. The Maillard reaction—which creates that beautiful brown crust—starts at 300°F and ramps up quickly around 350°F. At Purple Café, we preheated cast iron pans for 5-7 minutes over medium-high heat until a drop of water instantly vaporized. If you can&apos;t hold your hand over the pan for more than 2-3 seconds, it&apos;s ready.
              </p>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">What is the Maillard reaction and why does it matter?</h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                The Maillard reaction is a chemical reaction between amino acids and sugars that creates the flavorful brown crust on seared meat. It occurs between 300-400°F and produces hundreds of flavor compounds that make restaurant-quality steaks taste so good. This is different from caramelization—the Maillard reaction involves proteins, not just sugars.

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">Why does my steak stick to the pan?</h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                Sticking is normal at first—steaks will naturally stick to the pan initially, then release when a proper crust forms. The main causes of excessive sticking are: pan not hot enough, wet steak surface, or moving the steak too early. Pat steaks completely dry, preheat the pan to 400-450°F, and don&apos;t touch the steak for 3-4 minutes. When the crust is ready, it releases naturally.

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">Why is my steak turning grey instead of brown?</h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                Grey steak means you&apos;re steaming, not searing. Common causes: moisture on the steak surface (always pat bone-dry with paper towels), pan not hot enough (preheat 5-7 minutes), or overcrowding the pan (which drops temperature). Moisture creates steam, and steam prevents the Maillard reaction. One steak per 10-inch pan maximum.
              </p>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">Should I use oil or butter for searing steak?</h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                Use high smoke-point oil for searing—refined avocado oil (520°F), ghee (480°F), or safflower oil work best. Butter&apos;s smoke point is only 350°F, so it burns at proper searing temperatures. The professional technique: sear in high smoke-point oil, then add butter in the last minute for basting. You get the high-heat sear without burning.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">What&apos;s the best oil for high-heat steak searing?</h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                Refined avocado oil (smoke point 520°F) or ghee/clarified butter (480°F) are ideal for searing. At Purple Café during 200+ cover nights, we used clarified butter because it combines high smoke point with rich flavor. Avoid extra virgin olive oil (320°F smoke point) and regular butter (350°F)—both burn and create acrid flavors at searing temperatures.

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">How do I know when to flip my steak?</h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                Wait 3-4 minutes without moving the steak, then check the edge—when you see a brown crust climbing about ⅓ up the side, it&apos;s ready to flip. The steak will release easily from the pan when the crust is properly formed. Flipping too early tears the developing crust and creates grey, steamed meat instead of a proper sear.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">Should I season steak before or after searing?</h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                Season generously with kosher salt immediately before searing—within 3 minutes of hitting the pan. Salt draws out moisture, so salting too early (10-30 minutes before) creates surface wetness that prevents browning. Professional kitchens salt right before searing, or at least 45 minutes ahead (dry brining). The 10-40 minute window is the worst time.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">Why is there so much smoke when I sear steak?</h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                Smoke is normal and expected when searing at proper temperatures (400-450°F). At Purple Café, we ran exhaust fans on high during service because proper searing produces smoke. If there&apos;s no smoke, your pan isn&apos;t hot enough for the Maillard reaction. Minimize smoke by using minimal oil (or oil the steak directly instead of the pan) and ensuring good ventilation.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">Can I sear steak in a stainless steel pan instead of cast iron?</h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                Yes—stainless steel works excellently for searing if it&apos;s heavy-gauge. Cast iron retains heat better when you add cold meat, but stainless steel heats more evenly and is easier to deglaze for pan sauces. At Purple Café, we used both. The key is a heavy pan (thin pans lose heat instantly) preheated for 5-7 minutes until screaming hot.
