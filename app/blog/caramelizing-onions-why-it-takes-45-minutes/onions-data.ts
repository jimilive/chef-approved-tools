      { name: "Prep the Onions", text: "Slice onions pole to pole, about ⅛\" thick. Thinner burns, thicker takes forever. Use a sharp knife — dull blades crush, releasing water too fast." },
      { name: "Start with Fat", text: "Heat 2 tbsp of butter and a touch of oil in the pan over medium heat. The oil raises the butter's smoke point, giving you cushion." },
      { name: "Sweat and Steam", text: "Add the onions and a pinch of salt. Stir to coat evenly. At first, they'll soften and release moisture. This isn't caramelization — it's prep work. Keep the heat steady. If you hear sizzling, reduce it." },
      { name: "The Slow Browning", text: "Stir every 5–7 minutes, scraping the fond (those brown bits) from the pan. If the pan dries or starts to stick, add a splash of water or stock to deglaze. The onions will shift from white → gold → deep amber. Each shade is sweeter than the last." },
      { name: "The Finish", text: "When the onions are mahogany brown and jammy, deglaze one last time with water, wine, or sherry. Stir and reduce. The texture should be glossy and thick, not oily. Taste — if they're bitter, you went too hot. If they're bland, you didn't go long enough." }

      {
        question: "Can I use olive oil instead of butter?",
        answer: "Yes, but butter adds depth and creaminess. Try a 50/50 mix for the best of both worlds. Pure olive oil works fine and has a higher smoke point, but you lose the rich, nutty flavor that butter develops during the long cooking process. The combination gives you both stability and flavor."
      },
      {
        question: "How long does it really take to caramelize onions?",
        answer: "About 40-50 minutes, depending on pan, stove, and onion type. Stainless steel pans may take slightly longer than cast iron because they don't retain heat as aggressively. Sweet onions like Vidalia caramelize slightly faster than yellow onions due to higher sugar content. There are no legitimate shortcuts—the time is necessary for proper flavor development."
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need to cover the pan when caramelizing onions?",
        answer: "No—you want evaporation, not steaming. Covering the pan traps moisture, which prevents the sugars from concentrating and browning. The goal is to slowly drive off the water content (about 89% of the onion) so the sugars can caramelize. Covering defeats this process and leaves you with soggy, pale onions instead of deep, sweet caramelization."
      },
      {
        question: "Why are my caramelized onions watery?",
        answer: "You started too crowded or too low. Use a wider pan and a little more heat next time. Overcrowding traps steam between the onion pieces, preventing proper evaporation. The heat should be medium-low—high enough to evaporate moisture but not so high that the onions burn. If your onions are swimming in liquid after 20 minutes, increase the heat slightly."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I freeze caramelized onions?",
        answer: "Absolutely. Portion into small containers or ice cube trays for instant flavor boosts. Caramelized onions freeze beautifully for up to 3 months. Freeze them in tablespoon-sized portions so you can grab exactly what you need for soups, sauces, eggs, or burgers. They thaw quickly and retain their deep, sweet flavor."
      },
      {
        question: "Why do recipes say 10 minutes when it really takes 45?",
        answer: "Because many recipes confuse softened onions with caramelized onions. Softened onions are translucent and cooked through but still pale—that takes about 10 minutes. True caramelization requires breaking down the sugars into hundreds of new flavor compounds, which only happens with extended low heat. The difference in flavor is dramatic, but many home cooks have never tasted properly caramelized onions."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I add sugar to speed up caramelization?",
        answer: "You can, but it flattens the flavor and creates a one-dimensional sweetness. Natural caramelization develops complex layers—sweet, savory, slightly bitter, umami—that added sugar can't replicate. The slow breakdown of the onion's natural sugars creates depth. Adding sugar just makes them brown faster without the same flavor development."
      },
      {
        question: "What's the difference between sautéed and caramelized onions?",
        answer: "Sautéed onions are cooked quickly over medium-high heat until softened and lightly browned (about 8-10 minutes). Caramelized onions are cooked slowly over medium-low heat for 40-50 minutes until deep brown and jammy. The extended time allows the natural sugars to break down and create new flavor compounds through the Maillard reaction and caramelization. The taste difference is enormous."
