        question: "Do I need both a chef's knife and a santoku?",
        answer: "Not necessarily, but they excel at different tasks. The chef's knife is your all-rounder with a curved blade for rocking cuts. The santoku's straight edge and lighter weight make it faster for high-volume vegetable prep. Many professional cooks use both."
      },
      {
        question: "Will the Victorinox last as long as the Wüsthof?",
        answer: "Yes, with proper care. Victorinox knives have been documented in professional kitchens still performing after 10+ years of heavy use. Both knives will last decades if maintained properly."
      },
      {
        question: "Is forged really better than stamped?",
        answer: "Forged knives are built differently but not necessarily better. Forging creates a thicker, more substantial knife. Stamping creates a thinner, lighter, more flexible blade. The Victorinox proves that stamped knives can perform at professional levels."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I start with Victorinox and add the Santoku later?",
        answer: "Absolutely—this is the recommended path. Master the fundamentals with a Victorinox chef's knife. After you're comfortable with knife skills and find yourself doing lots of vegetable prep, add the Santoku as a specialized tool."
