      "The short answer: Victorinox delivers exceptional performance at a fraction of the price. For most home cooks, that makes it the smarter choice. But Wüsthof's forged construction and superior edge retention earn its premium for cooks who value those qualities."

    questions: [
      {
        question: "Is Victorinox as good as Wüsthof?",
        answer: "For cutting performance, Victorinox delivers excellent results. The main differences are edge retention (Wüsthof holds an edge longer), weight (Wüsthof is heavier), and construction (forged vs stamped). For most home cooks, Victorinox is more than sufficient."
      },
      {
        question: "Why do professional chefs use Victorinox?",
        answer: "Commercial kitchens prioritize durability, ease of maintenance, and value. Victorinox knives survive the abuse of high-volume professional use, sharpen easily, and cost little to replace if damaged. They're NSF certified for commercial sanitation standards."
      },
      {
        question: "Is Wüsthof worth the extra money?",
        answer: "It depends on your priorities. If you value superior edge retention, forged construction, heirloom quality, and the heft of a heavier knife, Wüsthof justifies its premium. If you prioritize value and prefer a lighter knife, the Victorinox delivers excellent performance for less."
      },
      {
        question: "Which brand holds an edge longer?",
        answer: "Wüsthof, due to harder steel (58 HRC vs 55-56 HRC). However, harder steel is also more difficult to sharpen when it does dull. The Victorinox needs more frequent honing but sharpens much more easily."
      },
      {
        question: "What's the deal with the Wüsthof bolster?",
        answer: "The full bolster on the Wüsthof Classic provides a finger guard and traditional look, but it makes sharpening the heel of the blade difficult. Over years of use, this can create an uneven edge. Some cooks love it, others find it problematic."
      },
      {
        question: "Which is better for beginners?",
        answer: "Victorinox. The softer steel is more forgiving of technique mistakes, the lighter weight is easier to control, and the lower price point means less anxiety about damaging an expensive knife while learning."
