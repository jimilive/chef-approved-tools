      {
        question: "Can stainless steel become nonstick?",
        answer: "Not in the Teflon sense, but a seasoned stainless surface behaves similarly if heated and oiled properly."
      },
      {
        question: "Why does my food burn instead of brown?",
        answer: "Heat's too high. You're burning sugars before proteins brown. Lower the temp slightly."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I use butter for searing?",
        answer: "Butter alone burns quickly. Mix it with oil or add it after browning."
      },
      {
        question: "Is stainless steel better than cast iron?",
        answer: "Different tools: stainless is responsive and great for sauces; cast iron holds heat for deep browning."
      },
      {
        question: "What's the best way to clean stuck food?",
        answer: "Simmer water with baking soda in the pan for 5 minutes. Residue will lift right off."
      },
      {
        question: "How do I know when my stainless steel pan is hot enough?",
        answer: "Use the water drop test: flick a drop of water into the pan. If it beads up and rolls around like mercury (Leidenfrost effect), your pan is ready. If it just sizzles and evaporates, it's not hot enough yet."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I cook eggs in stainless steel without sticking?",
        answer: "Yes, but eggs are the most challenging food. Preheat thoroughly, use adequate fat, and keep heat at medium-low. Once the eggs set, they'll release. Many pros still prefer nonstick for eggs."
      },
      {
        question: "Why does food stick more in some pans than others?",
        answer: "Pan quality matters. Thin stainless has hot spots that cause uneven heating and sticking. Heavy-gauge, multi-ply pans (aluminum or copper core) distribute heat evenly, preventing localized bonding."
