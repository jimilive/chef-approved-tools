        question: "My child is a super-taster. Will they ever eat broccoli?",
        answer: "Probably not as kids, but taste sensitivity decreases with age. Super-tasters often accept bitter vegetables in their teens or twenties. Focus on vegetables they can tolerate now (sweet potatoes, carrots, corn) and keep offering broccoli without pressure. They might surprise you eventually."
      },
      {
        question: "How do I know if I'm overcooking broccoli?",
        answer: "If your kitchen smells like sulfur (rotten eggs or dirty socks), you overcooked it. If the broccoli is mushy or olive-drab green instead of bright green, you overcooked it. If kids run away from the table, you definitely overcooked it."
      },
      {
        question: "Is broccoli with cheese sauce still healthy?",
        answer: "Yes! Broccoli with cheese sauce is infinitely healthier than no broccoli at all. The vegetables provide nutrients; the cheese makes kids willing to eat them. That's a win. You can gradually reduce cheese as they get used to the flavor."
