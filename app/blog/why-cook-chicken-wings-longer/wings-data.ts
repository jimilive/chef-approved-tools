        question: "What internal temperature should chicken wings reach for the best texture?",
        answer: "While 165°F is the minimum safe temperature, chicken wings achieve optimal texture at 185°F-195°F. At this higher temperature, the collagen in connective tissue has time to break down into gelatin, creating tender meat that falls off the bone easily rather than clinging stubbornly."

      {
        question: "Why do chicken wings need to cook longer than chicken breast?",
        answer: "Chicken wings contain significantly more connective tissue relative to meat mass than breasts. This includes collagen fibers, cartilage, and ligaments that require extended heat exposure to break down. Breast meat has minimal connective tissue and dries out when overcooked, while wings benefit from the extra time needed to convert tough collagen into tender gelatin."
      },
      {
        question: "Will cooking chicken wings longer make them dry out?",
        answer: "No, wings cooked longer actually retain more perceived moisture. As collagen converts to gelatin during extended cooking, it holds water molecules and creates a succulent texture. The significant fat content in wings also bastes the meat from inside during cooking. This is opposite to chicken breast, which dries out rapidly when overcooked."

      {
        question: "How long should I cook chicken wings in an air fryer?",
        answer: "Air fry chicken wings at 375°F-400°F for 25-30 minutes total, shaking the basket or flipping wings every 8-10 minutes for even browning. The wings are done when the skin is deeply browned and the meat visibly pulls back from the bone ends, indicating proper collagen breakdown."

      {
        question: "How can I tell when chicken wings are perfectly done without a thermometer?",
        answer: "Look for these visual and tactile cues: meat visibly pulling back from bone ends (exposing 1/4 to 1/2 inch of bone), deeply golden to light brown skin with visible crisping, joints that bend easily when held, bones that wiggle independently of the meat with minimal resistance, and meat that compresses easily and begins separating from bone with gentle pressure."

      {
        question: "What is the best oven temperature for baking chicken wings?",
        answer: "Use a two-stage approach for best results: Start at 375°F for 35-40 minutes to render fat and break down collagen, then increase to 425°F for the final 10-15 minutes to crisp the skin. This method ensures tender meat with crackling-crisp skin. Total cooking time should be 45-60 minutes for properly cooked wings."
