      {
        question: "Are hotel pans only for restaurants?",
        answer: "No. They are perfect for home cooks who want professional-level organization. If you meal prep, cook in batches, or host family gatherings, hotel pans will change your kitchen."
      },
      {
        question: "How do I know which size to buy?",
        answer: "Start with 1/6 pans (6-inch depth) for most home use. These are the most versatile size, big enough for meal prep portions but not so large they dominate your refrigerator."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I put plastic hotel pans in the freezer?",
        answer: "Yes, plastic hotel pans are freezer-safe. They can be used for freezing stock, soups, and cooked grains."
      },
      {
        question: "Can metal hotel pans go in the oven?",
        answer: "Yes, metal hotel pans are oven-safe up to 500°F+. Use them for roasting vegetables, baking casseroles, or holding food hot."
      },
      {
        question: "How long do hotel pans last?",
        answer: "Decades. Plastic pans can last 20+ years with daily use. Metal pans are essentially indestructible. This is a one-time investment."
      },
      {
        question: "Will plastic pans stain from tomato sauce?",
        answer: "Not if you buy opaque white versions. Translucent/clear plastic can stain, but solid white plastic resists staining even from pigmented foods."
      },
      {
        question: "Are Curta pans as good as Cambro?",
        answer: "Cambro is the premium standard, but Curta delivers 90% of the performance at 50% of the cost. For home use, Curta is the smarter choice. Both are NSF approved and restaurant-grade."
