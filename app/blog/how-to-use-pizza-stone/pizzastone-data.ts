        question: "How long should I preheat a pizza stone?", answer: "45-60 minutes minimum at maximum oven temperature. A 1-hour preheat brings the stone to 509°F, while 45 minutes reaches only 451°F. This 58-degree difference dramatically affects crust browning and crispness. Without adequate preheating, you get soggy, undercooked pizza."
      }, {
        question: "Why does my pizza stone keep cracking?", answer: "Thermal shock from rapid temperature changes causes cracking. Never place a cold stone in a hot oven, run water on a hot stone, or place frozen food on a preheated stone. Always start with the stone in a cold oven and preheat together. Let it cool completely before removing."
      }, {
        question: "Can I use soap to clean my pizza stone?", answer: "Never use soap on pizza stones. The porous material absorbs soap that cannot be fully rinsed out, making your next pizza taste like dish soap. Clean with hot water, scraping, and a stiff brush only. Stains are normal and don't affect performance."
      }, {
        question: "Should I use a pizza stone or baking steel?", answer: "Steel transfers heat 20x faster than stone, creating crispier crusts and faster cooking (6-8 minutes vs 10-12 minutes). Steel costs more but lasts indefinitely and can't crack. Stone is less expensive and produces traditional pizzeria-style texture. Both work excellently with proper technique."
      }, {
        question: "Do I need a pizza peel or can I use parchment paper?", answer: "Parchment paper is beginner-friendly and foolproof, the dough can't stick. Pizza peels are traditional and produce maximum crust crispness. Use parchment while learning, transition to a peel once comfortable. Parchment chars above 450°F but won't catch fire if removed after 2-3 minutes."
      }, {
        question: "Why is my pizza crust still soggy after using a pizza stone?", answer: "Either inadequate preheating (less than 45 minutes) or too much sauce/wet toppings. The stone must reach 475-500°F surface temperature to crisp the crust. Use 2-3 tablespoons of sauce per 12-inch pizza, pre-cook wet vegetables, and drain/blot all toppings."
      }, {
        question: "Can I leave my pizza stone in the oven all the time?", answer: "Yes. Leaving the stone permanently in the oven (on the middle or lower rack) acts as thermal mass for more even oven temperature. It's always ready for pizza and reduces handling that could cause cracking. Remove before self-cleaning cycles only."
      }, {
        question: "What thickness pizza stone should I buy?", answer: "3/4 inch is optimal for home ovens. Excellent heat retention, 45-minute preheat time, good durability, manageable weight. 1/2 inch works but requires 60-minute preheat and cools faster. 1 inch is overkill, requiring 75+ minutes to preheat and weighing 20+ pounds."
