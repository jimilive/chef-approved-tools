        question: "Can't I just use one size for everything?",
        answer: "Yes. Millions of home cooks use only an 8-inch and cook perfectly well. The 10-inch is an efficiency upgrade, not a necessity. If you only own one chef's knife your entire life, the 8-inch is the better choice for versatility."
      },
      {
        question: "Will the 10-inch make me a better cook?",
        answer: "No. A 10-inch makes certain tasks faster and easier, but technique matters infinitely more than blade length. A skilled cook with an 8-inch will outperform a beginner with a 10-inch every single time."
      },
      {
        question: "I'm 5'10 with average hands—which should I get?",
        answer: "Start with the 8-inch. At your height with average hands, you're right in the middle zone where either knife could work. The 8-inch is more forgiving for learning and more versatile for mixed tasks. Add the 10-inch later if you find yourself doing a lot of bulk prep."
      },
      {
        question: "What about a 12-inch chef's knife?",
        answer: "Skip it for home use. A 12-inch requires even more space and technique. It's primarily used in professional settings for breaking down large primals or carving stations. The jump from 8 to 10 inches is useful. The jump from 10 to 12 inches is rarely justified for home cooking."
