        question: "Is stainless steel really eco-friendly?",
        answer: "Yes—it's 100% recyclable and often made from reclaimed metal. Longevity is what makes it truly low-impact. Stainless steel cookware can last 20-30 years or more with proper care, and when it finally reaches end of life, every ounce can be melted down and reused. The embodied carbon is offset by decades of use."
      },
      {
        question: "What's wrong with nonstick pans?",
        answer: "They wear out fast, and most coatings aren't recyclable. Use them only for delicate tasks and replace responsibly. Most nonstick pans last 1-3 years before the coating degrades. The constant replacement cycle creates waste and carbon emissions. If you use nonstick, invest in quality brands and replace when the coating fails—never use damaged nonstick."

      {
        question: "Can cast iron go on induction?",
        answer: "Absolutely—it's magnetic and works beautifully. Cast iron is one of the best materials for induction cooking because it's naturally magnetic and retains heat exceptionally well. The heavy mass pairs perfectly with induction's precise temperature control. It works on gas, electric, induction, and even campfires—true versatility."
      },
      {
        question: "What's the most sustainable kitchen purchase?",
        answer: "Anything you'll use weekly for the next decade. Utility beats novelty every time. The greenest tool is the one you actually use and keep for years. A $200 pan you use daily for 20 years has far less environmental impact than a $30 pan you replace every 2 years. Buy for longevity and frequency of use, not trends."
      },
      {
        question: "Should I repair or replace old cookware?",
        answer: "Repair if you can. Re-season, rehandle, or regrind—chefs have been doing it for centuries. Cast iron can be re-seasoned indefinitely. Stainless steel handles can be replaced. Knives can be sharpened, reground, and rehandled. Before you discard quality equipment, research repair options. The most sustainable tool is the one you already own."
      },
      {
        question: "How much money does \"buy once, cry once\" actually save?",
        answer: "Replacing a $25 pan every 2 years for 20 years costs $250 and creates 10 discarded pans. Buying a $150 quality pan once costs $150 total and creates zero waste for decades. You save $100 and avoid contributing to landfills. The initial investment hurts, but the lifetime savings—financial and environmental—are substantial."

        question: "Are bamboo cutting boards sustainable?",
        answer: "Quality solid bamboo is, but cheap glued bamboo boards aren't. Many bamboo boards use formaldehyde-based adhesives and split after a few years. Solid bamboo or end-grain hardwood boards last decades and can be resurfaced multiple times. Choose thick, single-piece construction or quality end-grain over cheap laminated bamboo."
      },
      {
        question: "What should I do with old kitchen equipment I'm replacing?",
        answer: "Donate functional items to shelters, culinary programs, or charity kitchens. Recycle metal cookware through scrap metal recycling. Many cities have metal recycling programs that accept stainless steel, aluminum, and cast iron. Avoid throwing usable equipment in the trash—someone else can benefit from what you're upgrading."
