            {
              question: "What's the difference between kosher salt and table salt?",
              answer: "Kosher salt has larger, irregular flakes with no additives, while table salt has fine, uniform grains plus iodine and anti-caking agents. Kosher salt is easier to pinch and control, dissolves at an ideal rate for seasoning, and has clean flavor untainted by iodine. The flake size makes over-salting harder—you can see and feel how much you're using."
            },
            {
              question: "Why is it called \"kosher\" salt?",
              answer: "It's called kosher salt because the large flakes are ideal for koshering meat (drawing out blood per Jewish dietary law), not because the salt itself is kosher (most salt is). The coarse texture absorbs moisture from meat surfaces effectively. The name stuck even though home cooks use it for general cooking, not koshering."
            },
            {
              question: "What's the difference between Diamond Crystal and Morton kosher salt?",
              answer: "Diamond Crystal has hollow, light flakes (280mg sodium per ¼ tsp) formed by evaporation, while Morton has dense, rolled flakes (480mg per ¼ tsp) from mechanical processing. Diamond Crystal is less salty by volume, dissolves faster, and is more forgiving—it's harder to over-salt. After 24 years using Diamond Crystal (6 at Purple Café, 18 at home), I've never switched—it's what professionals prefer."
            },
            {
              question: "Can I substitute table salt for kosher salt in recipes?",
              answer: "Use half the amount of table salt as kosher salt, but by weight not volume. 1 teaspoon table salt equals 2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal or 1¼ teaspoons Morton kosher salt. Better solution: switch to kosher salt permanently and use recipes calling for it. Volume measurements for salt are inherently inconsistent—weigh salt in grams for precision, or use kosher salt consistently."
            },
            {
              question: "Why do chefs prefer Diamond Crystal over Morton?",
              answer: "Diamond Crystal dissolves faster (reducing over-salting risk), has lighter texture (easier to pinch evenly), contains zero additives (pure salt flavor), and is less dense (more forgiving in seasoning). At Purple Café, we used exclusively Diamond Crystal because the faster dissolving rate prevented the over-salted steaks that happen with Morton. Professional kitchens standardize on one brand to ensure consistency."
            },
            {
              question: "Is kosher salt healthier than table salt?",
              answer: "No—kosher salt and table salt are both 100% sodium chloride with the same health effects gram-for-gram. The difference is that kosher salt lacks iodine (a beneficial additive in table salt) but also lacks anti-caking agents. Kosher salt's advantage is control and flavor, not health. If you use only kosher salt, ensure you get iodine from other dietary sources (seafood, dairy, eggs)."
            },
            {
              question: "Does kosher salt have iodine?",
              answer: "No—kosher salt typically contains no iodine or other additives, just pure salt. Table salt has added iodine to prevent iodine deficiency diseases. If you use kosher salt exclusively, ensure your diet includes iodine from other sources: seafood, dairy, eggs, or iodized salt in baking. At Purple Café, we used kosher salt for cooking but kept iodized salt in storage for specific recipes."
            },
            {
              question: "Why does kosher salt taste different from table salt?",
              answer: "Pure kosher salt doesn't taste different from table salt chemically—both are sodium chloride. The perceived taste difference comes from table salt's iodine and anti-caking additives, which can taste slightly metallic or chemical. Diamond Crystal's clean taste comes from purity (no additives) and how it dissolves on your tongue (the flake structure affects perception)."
            },
            {
              question: "Can I use kosher salt for baking?",
              answer: "Yes, but weigh it or reduce volume by half compared to table salt. Baking recipes are sensitive to salt quantity, and using kosher salt by volume in recipes calling for table salt over-salts baked goods. Best practice: weigh salt in grams for baking (5g table salt = 5g kosher salt), or use recipes that specify kosher salt. I use Diamond Crystal for everything, including baking."
            },
            {
              question: "How should I store kosher salt?",
              answer: "Store kosher salt in an airtight container in a cool, dry place—a jar or container near the stove for easy pinching. Salt doesn't spoil, but moisture causes clumping (especially with humid kitchens). At Purple Café, we kept Diamond Crystal in large containers on the line for easy access during service. Avoid storing directly in the cardboard box—it absorbs moisture and the box deteriorates."

          </p>

          <p>
            In this guide, we&apos;ll explore the science, texture, flavor, and practical reasons behind the chef&apos;s preference for kosher salt. We&apos;ll also give you actionable tips for cooking, seasoning steaks, and everyday kitchen use.
          </p>

          <h2>What Makes Kosher Salt Unique?</h2>

          <p>
            At its core, kosher salt differs from table salt in three key ways:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Texture:</strong> Kosher salt has large, flaky crystals that are easy to pinch, sprinkle, and control. This makes it ideal for chefs who season intuitively rather than measuring every pinch.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No additives:</strong> Unlike most table salt, kosher salt typically has no iodine or anti-caking agents, which can sometimes impart a bitter taste.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Volume vs. weight:</strong> Because of its larger crystals, a teaspoon of kosher salt weighs less than a teaspoon of table salt, making it easier to season gradually and avoid over-salting.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This combination of texture and purity is why chefs worldwide choose kosher salt for almost every dish.
          </p>

            </CTAVisibilityTracker> is a standout. Here&apos;s why professional cooks swear by it:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              ✅ <strong>Consistent crystal size:</strong> Each pinch delivers predictable seasoning.
            </li>
            <li>
              ✅ <strong>Lighter crystals:</strong> Easy to sprinkle and control compared to heavier, denser salts like Morton.
            </li>
            <li>
              ✅ <strong>Pure flavor:</strong> No additives, no metallic taste — just clean, briny seasoning.
            </li>
            <li>
              ✅ <strong>Perfect for seasoning meat:</strong> Its flakes adhere beautifully to steaks, poultry, and fish, forming an even crust during cooking.
            </li>
          </ul>

              <strong>From 24 Years of Experience:</strong> After 6 years using Diamond Crystal exclusively at Purple Café and 18 more years at home, it&apos;s the only brand I recommend.

          <p>
            Chefs often prefer Diamond Crystal for tasks ranging from brining to finishing, and home cooks quickly notice the difference when they switch from table salt.
          </p>

          <h2>How Kosher Salt Enhances Cooking</h2>

          <p>
            Kosher salt isn&apos;t just about taste — it&apos;s about control and technique. Here&apos;s why professional cooks use it for everything from prep to plating:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Easy pinching and sprinkling:</strong> Large crystals make it simple to season evenly without overdoing it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Layering flavor:</strong> Chefs can add kosher salt at multiple stages — on meat before searing, in water for pasta, or finishing vegetables — without risk of over-salting.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Better texture:</strong> When used on meat, kosher salt draws moisture to the surface, creating an ideal crust when seared.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Reliable measurement by hand:</strong> Culinary pros rarely weigh salt; kosher salt lets them &quot;season to taste&quot; with precision.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This technique pairs perfectly with professional tools like a <CTAVisibilityTracker

          <h2>Pinch, Sprinkle, and Taste: Using Kosher Salt Correctly</h2>

          <p>
            Even the best salt can be misused. Here&apos;s how chefs get it right:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Pinch between thumb and fingers:</strong> The tactile feedback lets you gauge how much salt you&apos;re adding.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Sprinkle evenly:</strong> For meat, vegetables, or pasta water, scatter the crystals for uniform seasoning.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Layer your seasoning:</strong> Add a little early and a little late to build depth of flavor.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Taste as you go:</strong> The controlled texture of kosher salt makes it easier to adjust without over-salting.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <div className="bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200 rounded-xl p-6 my-6">
            <p className="mb-0">
              <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> For steaks, use kosher salt generously on the surface before searing. The large crystals help form a perfect crust while seasoning the meat. See our <CTAVisibilityTracker

          <h2>Other Kitchen Uses for Kosher Salt</h2>

          <p>
            Beyond seasoning, kosher salt is incredibly versatile in the professional kitchen:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              🧂 <strong>Brining:</strong> Kosher salt dissolves predictably in water for perfect brine ratios.
            </li>
            <li>
              🥩 <strong>Meat rubs:</strong> Its large crystals adhere to proteins, forming a flavorful crust.
            </li>
            <li>
              🥔 <strong>Vegetable prep:</strong> Sprinkle on roasted or blanched vegetables to enhance natural sweetness.
            </li>
            <li>
              🍳 <strong>Finishing:</strong> Use sparingly on finished dishes for texture and visual appeal.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            At Purple Café, we used Diamond Crystal for all of these applications daily. From brining chicken for our rotisserie to finishing vegetables at expo, it was the workhorse of our seasoning program.
          </p>

          <h2>Why Chefs Avoid Table Salt for Most Tasks</h2>

          <p>
            While table salt is fine for baking or recipes where exact measurement matters, it&apos;s less forgiving in professional kitchens:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Fine grains can clump and over-salt dishes quickly.
            </li>
            <li>
              Iodized table salt may leave an off-flavor in delicate foods.
            </li>
            <li>
              Texture doesn&apos;t help with crust formation on meat or control when seasoning by hand.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Kosher salt solves all of these problems, making it the default choice for chefs. In 6 years at Purple Café, I never saw table salt used on the line—only kosher salt for cooking and fine sea salt for the table.

          <h2>Choosing the Right Kosher Salt Brand</h2>

          <p>
            Not all kosher salts are created equal. Key things to look for:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Crystal shape:</strong> Flaky vs. coarse — flaky is easier to control.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Purity:</strong> Avoid added iodine or anti-caking agents unless recipe-specific.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Trusted brands:</strong> Diamond Crystal is the chef&apos;s go-to. Morton is denser but also widely used.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Kosher salt isn&apos;t just a seasoning — it&apos;s a chef&apos;s tool. From controlling flavor to creating the perfect crust on steak, it&apos;s integral to professional cooking. <CTAVisibilityTracker

          </p>

          <p>
            After 6 years at Purple Café and 18 years in my home kitchen, Diamond Crystal remains the only salt I buy. It&apos;s been the foundation of consistent, professional seasoning for nearly a quarter-century. Whether you&apos;re running a restaurant or cooking dinner at home, it makes a difference you can taste.
          </p>

          <p>
            Next time you cook, remember: professional chefs don&apos;t just sprinkle salt. They <strong>season intentionally, layer flavors, and rely on kosher salt to do it right</strong>. Try it in your kitchen and see the difference — your taste buds will thank you.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">What&apos;s the difference between kosher salt and table salt?</h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                Kosher salt has larger, irregular flakes with no additives, while table salt has fine, uniform grains plus iodine and anti-caking agents. Kosher salt is easier to pinch and control, dissolves at an ideal rate for seasoning, and has clean flavor untainted by iodine. The flake size makes over-salting harder—you can see and feel how much you&apos;re using.
              </p>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">Why is it called &quot;kosher&quot; salt?</h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                It&apos;s called kosher salt because the large flakes are ideal for koshering meat (drawing out blood per Jewish dietary law), not because the salt itself is kosher (most salt is). The coarse texture absorbs moisture from meat surfaces effectively. The name stuck even though home cooks use it for general cooking, not koshering.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">What&apos;s the difference between Diamond Crystal and Morton kosher salt?</h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                Diamond Crystal has hollow, light flakes (280mg sodium per ¼ tsp) formed by evaporation, while Morton has dense, rolled flakes (480mg per ¼ tsp) from mechanical processing. Diamond Crystal is less salty by volume, dissolves faster, and is more forgiving—it&apos;s harder to over-salt. After 24 years using Diamond Crystal (6 at Purple Café, 18 at home), I&apos;ve never switched—it&apos;s what professionals prefer.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">Can I substitute table salt for kosher salt in recipes?</h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                Use half the amount of table salt as kosher salt, but by weight not volume. 1 teaspoon table salt equals 2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal or 1¼ teaspoons Morton kosher salt. Better solution: switch to kosher salt permanently and use recipes calling for it. Volume measurements for salt are inherently inconsistent—weigh salt in grams for precision, or use kosher salt consistently.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">Why do chefs prefer Diamond Crystal over Morton?</h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                Diamond Crystal dissolves faster (reducing over-salting risk), has lighter texture (easier to pinch evenly), contains zero additives (pure salt flavor), and is less dense (more forgiving in seasoning). At Purple Café, we used exclusively Diamond Crystal because the faster dissolving rate prevented the over-salted steaks that happen with Morton. Professional kitchens standardize on one brand to ensure consistency.

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">Is kosher salt healthier than table salt?</h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                No—kosher salt and table salt are both 100% sodium chloride with the same health effects gram-for-gram. The difference is that kosher salt lacks iodine (a beneficial additive in table salt) but also lacks anti-caking agents. Kosher salt&apos;s advantage is control and flavor, not health. If you use only kosher salt, ensure you get iodine from other dietary sources (seafood, dairy, eggs).
              </p>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">Does kosher salt have iodine?</h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                No—kosher salt typically contains no iodine or other additives, just pure salt. Table salt has added iodine to prevent iodine deficiency diseases. If you use kosher salt exclusively, ensure your diet includes iodine from other sources: seafood, dairy, eggs, or iodized salt in baking. At Purple Café, we used kosher salt for cooking but kept iodized salt in storage for specific recipes.

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">Why does kosher salt taste different from table salt?</h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                Pure kosher salt doesn&apos;t taste different from table salt chemically—both are sodium chloride. The perceived taste difference comes from table salt&apos;s iodine and anti-caking additives, which can taste slightly metallic or chemical. Diamond Crystal&apos;s clean taste comes from purity (no additives) and how it dissolves on your tongue (the flake structure affects perception).

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">Can I use kosher salt for baking?</h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                Yes, but weigh it or reduce volume by half compared to table salt. Baking recipes are sensitive to salt quantity, and using kosher salt by volume in recipes calling for table salt over-salts baked goods. Best practice: weigh salt in grams for baking (5g table salt = 5g kosher salt), or use recipes that specify kosher salt. I use Diamond Crystal for everything, including baking.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">How should I store kosher salt?</h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                Store kosher salt in an airtight container in a cool, dry place—a jar or container near the stove for easy pinching. Salt doesn&apos;t spoil, but moisture causes clumping (especially with humid kitchens). At Purple Café, we kept Diamond Crystal in large containers on the line for easy access during service. Avoid storing directly in the cardboard box—it absorbs moisture and the box deteriorates.
