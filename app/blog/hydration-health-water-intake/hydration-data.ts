        question: "Can you drink too much water while cooking?",
        answer: "Overhydration (hyponatremia) is rare unless you drink several gallons in a short time without sweating. For typical home cooking sessions, this isn't a concern. Your body will naturally regulate fluid balance through urination. Professional athletes and extreme endurance events are more at risk than home cooks."
      },
      {
        question: "Does drinking cold water help cool you down in a hot kitchen?",
        answer: "Yes, but only slightly. Cold water (45-55°F) provides minor cooling and feels more refreshing than room-temperature water, which encourages you to drink more. The primary benefit is hydration; the cooling effect is secondary but welcome in hot kitchens."
      },
      {
        question: "How do I remember to drink water when I'm focused on cooking?",
        answer: "Build it into your cooking rhythm: 1) Keep water in arm's reach at your cooking station, 2) Drink every time a timer beeps, 3) Drink between cooking tasks (finished chopping? Drink. Done sauteing onions? Drink.), 4) Set a phone timer for every 30 minutes as a backup reminder."
