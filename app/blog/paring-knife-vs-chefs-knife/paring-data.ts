        question: "Can I just use my chef's knife for everything?",
        answer: "Technically yes, practically no. You'll struggle with peeling, deseeding, and detailed trimming. These tasks become frustrating without the right tool. But if you can only afford ONE knife right now? Get the chef's knife. Add the paring knife when budget allows."
      },
      {
        question: "Why do knife sets include 3-4 paring knives?",
        answer: "Marketing. Sets pad their piece count with multiple paring knives (straight edge, serrated, different sizes) to justify higher prices. Reality: You need ONE good 3-4 inch straight-edge paring knife. The other variations are unnecessary for home cooking."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I use a utility knife instead of a paring knife?",
        answer: "Utility knives (4-7 inches) fall in an awkward middle ground: too long for in-hand precision work, too short for efficient board work. Skip utility knives. A chef's knife plus paring knife gives better coverage with fewer redundant tools."
      },
      {
        question: "Is the Victorinox paring knife as good as the chef's knife?",
        answer: "Yes. Same steel quality, same manufacturing standards, same professional performance. The lower price point is purely because paring knives use less material. You're getting the same quality knife in a smaller package."
      },
      {
        question: "Should I buy a paring knife with a curved blade or straight blade?",
        answer: "Straight blade. Far more versatile. Curved paring knives (often called 'bird's beak' or 'tourné' knives) are specialty tools for specific garnish cuts. Unless you're making museum-quality vegetable carvings, you don't need it."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I peel with my chef's knife?",
        answer: "You can, but shouldn't. The blade is too long to control safely when peeling in hand. And it's slower than using the right tool. Exception: Peeling thick-skinned items on a cutting board (butternut squash, pineapple) works fine with a chef's knife."
