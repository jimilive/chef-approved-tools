      { name: "Let Pan Cool Completely", text: "Never put cold water on a hot pan—thermal shock can warp stainless steel. Let it cool to room temperature first." },
      { name: "Soak in Hot Water", text: "Fill the pan with hot water and let it soak for 15-30 minutes. This loosens burnt-on food and makes scrubbing easier." },
      { name: "Make Baking Soda Paste", text: "Mix baking soda with just enough water to form a thick paste. This mild abrasive is safe for stainless steel." },
      { name: "Apply and Scrub Gently", text: "Apply paste to burnt areas. Scrub with a nylon brush using circular motions. Never use steel wool—it scratches the surface permanently." },
      { name: "Use Vinegar for Stubborn Spots", text: "For tough burns, add white vinegar to the pan, bring to a simmer, then scrub. The acid helps break down carbonized residue." },
      { name: "Polish with Bar Keepers Friend", text: "For final polish or rainbow discoloration, apply Bar Keepers Friend, scrub gently, and rinse. This restores the original shine." },

      {
        question: "Can I use steel wool just once?",
        answer: "No. Even once will leave micro-scratches that dull and discolor your pan."
      },
      {
        question: "How do chefs clean stainless in restaurants?",
        answer: "Hot water soak, nylon scrub, and BKF. No fancy hacks."
      },
      {
        question: "What causes rainbow discoloration?",
        answer: "Heat oxidation. Remove it with vinegar or BKF polish."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I soak overnight?",
        answer: "Yes, but only in water or baking soda mix — never with bleach or harsh chemicals."
      },
      {
        question: "Will this work for All-Clad or Made In pans?",
        answer: "Yes — all quality stainless responds to these same steps."
      },
      {
        question: "Is it safe to use baking soda on non-stick pans?",
        answer: "No, this guide is for stainless steel only. Non-stick coatings require gentler cleaning with mild soap and soft sponges. Baking soda can damage non-stick surfaces."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I put stainless steel pans in the dishwasher?",
        answer: "You can, but hand washing is better for longevity. Dishwasher detergent is harsh and can dull the finish over time. Plus, burnt residue won't come off in a dishwasher anyway."
      },
      {
        question: "What if the burnt spot won't come off after one treatment?",
        answer: "Repeat the baking soda paste treatment. Severe burns may need 2-3 rounds. Let the paste sit longer (up to an hour) for stubborn spots. Patience beats aggressive scrubbing every time."
