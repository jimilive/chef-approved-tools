      {
        question: "Is KitchenAid still the best brand?",
        answer: "For most cooks, yes. The balance of power, attachments, and support is unmatched."
      },
      {
        question: "What about commercial models?",
        answer: "If you bake bread weekly, the Pro 600 or Ankarsrum is worth it."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I make dough in smaller mixers?",
        answer: "Yes, but reduce batch sizes by half to avoid straining the motor. Mix on lower speeds for longer periods. Smaller mixers work fine for occasional bread—just don't push them with double batches of stiff dough."
      },
      {
        question: "What attachments are worth it?",
        answer: "Pasta roller, meat grinder, and slicer/shredder. Skip the juicer."
      },
      {
        question: "How long do they last?",
        answer: "Well-built gear-drive mixers can last 20+ years with maintenance."
      },
      {
        question: "Should I buy tilt-head or bowl-lift?",
        answer: "Tilt-head is easier to use for everyday baking. Bowl-lift offers more stability and power for heavy doughs like bread and bagels. Choose based on what you bake most often."
      },
      {
        question: "What's the difference between gear-driven and belt-driven mixers?",
        answer: "Gear-driven mixers use metal gears for direct power transfer — more durable and powerful but louder. Belt-driven mixers use rubber belts — quieter but less durable under heavy loads. Professional-grade mixers are almost always gear-driven."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I repair a stand mixer myself?",
        answer: "Basic maintenance like greasing gears is doable at home. But gear replacement or motor issues require professional service. KitchenAid has widespread service networks; alternatives may have limited repair options."
