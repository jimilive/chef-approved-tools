        question: "Why should you lift lettuce out of water instead of draining it?",
        answer: "Dirt and sand sink to the bottom of the wash water. When you lift lettuce up and out, you leave the settled sediment behind. Draining by pouring into a colander sends all that dirt flowing across your clean lettuce, recontaminating the leaves you just washed."
      },
      {
        question: "How many times should you wash lettuce?",
        answer: "Wash lettuce three times for truly clean results. The first wash removes 80-90% of visible dirt. The second removes fine particles. The third eliminates remaining traces. If water still shows sediment after three washes, continue until it stays clear."
      },
      {
        question: "Is prewashed bagged lettuce safe to eat without washing?",
        answer: "Prewashed lettuce has been triple-washed commercially and is generally safe to eat directly. However, additional washing won't hurt and may remove any contamination that occurred after packaging. Unwashed head lettuce always requires thorough washing."
      },
      {
        question: "How do you store washed lettuce to keep it fresh?",
        answer: "Dry lettuce completely using a salad spinner or clean towels. Line a container with paper towels, add lettuce loosely without packing, and store in the refrigerator crisper drawer. Properly dried and stored washed lettuce keeps 3-5 days."
      },
      {
        question: "Why is it important to dry lettuce after washing?",
        answer: "Wet lettuce dilutes salad dressings, prevents dressing from adhering to leaves, and creates pools of liquid in salad bowls. Moisture also accelerates spoilage during storage. Always spin or pat lettuce completely dry before using or storing."
      },
      {
        question: "What water temperature should you use to wash lettuce?",
        answer: "Use cold water to wash lettuce. Cold water keeps leaves crisp and firm during washing. Warm or hot water causes lettuce to wilt and become limp, damaging texture and reducing storage life."
