        question: "Can I use metal utensils on cast iron?",
        answer: "Yes, but carefully. Keep angles shallow to avoid scraping seasoning. Wood and silicone are gentler options that won't risk damaging the seasoning you've built."

      {
        question: "Do wooden spoons harbor bacteria?",
        answer: "Research shows wood actually has antibacterial properties—bacteria die off on wooden surfaces while surviving in plastic grooves. Hand wash thoroughly with hot soapy water and dry immediately."

      {
        question: "What about bamboo utensils?",
        answer: "Bamboo is harder than traditional hardwoods and may be more likely to scratch delicate surfaces. Stick with softer woods like maple, beechwood, or olive for coated cookware."

      {
        question: "How do I know if my nonstick pan is damaged?",
        answer: "If you see visible scratches, the coating is flaking, or food starts sticking in specific areas, the pan should be replaced. Don't risk cooking with a damaged nonstick surface."
