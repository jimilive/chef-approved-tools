        "Garlic is one of the most powerful ingredients in cooking. It adds depth, complexity, and aromatic intensity to virtually every savory dish. But garlic is more than just flavor. It's also one of the healthiest ingredients you can cook with, packed with compounds that support immunity, heart health, and inflammation reduction.", "In professional kitchens, we went through pounds of garlic every single day, minced for sauces, sliced thin for pasta, roasted whole for spreads, confit in olive oil for richness. Garlic wasn't an ingredient; it was the foundation.", "But here's what most home cooks don't understand: **how you prepare and cook garlic completely changes what it contributes to a dish**. Raw garlic is sharp and pungent. Sautéed garlic is mellow and aromatic. Roasted garlic is sweet and nutty. The same ingredient, three totally different flavors. And if you burn it, even slightly, it turns bitter and ruins the whole dish.", "In this guide, I'm breaking down everything you need to know about garlic: health benefits, flavor science, preparation techniques, and the professional methods that make garlic taste incredible in every dish. This is the knowledge that separates home cooks from professionals."

            "When you crush, chop, or chew garlic, an enzyme called **alliinase** converts **alliin** (a sulfur compound) into **allicin**, the compound responsible for garlic's distinctive smell and most of its health benefits.", "Allicin is unstable and quickly breaks down into other sulfur compounds (like diallyl disulfide and ajoene), which also have health-promoting properties. This is why crushing or chopping garlic and letting it sit for 5-10 minutes before cooking is recommended. It allows allicin to form fully before heat destroys the enzyme."

            "Garlic has powerful antimicrobial, antiviral, and antifungal properties. Studies show that regular garlic consumption can reduce the frequency and duration of colds and flu. One study found that people who took garlic supplements were 63% less likely to catch a cold than those who took a placebo.", "**How to maximize this benefit:** Eat garlic raw or lightly cooked. Heavy cooking reduces allicin content, so if you're eating garlic for immune support, add it at the end of cooking or use it raw in dressings and spreads."

      ], restaurantReality: "At Il Pizzaiolo, we prepped garlic two different ways: minced for quick cooking (marinara, sautés) and whole cloves confit in olive oil for spreads and roasted applications. The head chef was obsessive about garlic. It had to be perfectly prepped, never burned, and used generously. One night, a new line cook burned a pan of garlic while making aglio e olio. The whole dish went in the trash and we had to start over. **The lesson he taught us:** \"Garlic is powerful. It can make a dish incredible or ruin it completely. There's no middle ground. If you burn garlic, you throw it away and start over. You never serve burnt garlic.\" That lesson stuck with me for 24 years. Respect garlic, use it properly, and it rewards you. Rush it or ignore it, and it punishes you."

            "Heat oil in a pan over medium heat (not high—garlic burns easily)", "Add minced or sliced garlic", "Stir constantly for 1-2 minutes until fragrant and lightly golden", "Add other ingredients immediately (garlic should never cook alone for long)"

    questions: [
      {
        question: "Is garlic still healthy after cooking?", answer: "Yes, but some of the health benefits are reduced. Allicin (the primary beneficial compound) is heat-sensitive and breaks down during cooking. However, other sulfur compounds remain intact and still provide health benefits. To maximize benefits, use a mix of cooked and raw garlic in your diet."
      }, {
        question: "Can I use garlic powder instead of fresh garlic?", answer: "For convenience, yes, but the flavor is different. Garlic powder has a concentrated, somewhat flat flavor compared to fresh garlic's aromatic complexity. Use 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder to replace 1 fresh clove. Never use garlic powder in dishes where garlic is the star (like aglio e olio)."
      }, {
        question: "How do I get the smell of garlic off my hands?", answer: "Rub your hands on stainless steel under cold running water. Stainless steel reacts with the sulfur compounds and neutralizes the odor. You can use a spoon, sink, or buy a special stainless steel 'soap' bar. Also works for onion smell."
