    introduction: [
      "I'll be honest with you: in 24 years of professional kitchen work, I've never had rust on my personal knives. Not once. That's not bragging. It's the result of habits I learned the hard way watching other cooks ruin good blades through neglect.",
      "But I've seen plenty of rusty knives come through professional kitchens. The prep cook who left his knife in the sink overnight. The new hire who stored a wet blade in a leather sheath. The home cook who brings in their grandmother's carbon steel knife, orange with oxidation, asking if it can be saved.",
      "The answer is almost always yes. Here's how to fix it, and more importantly, how to make sure it never happens again.",

    questions: [
      {
        question: "Can I use steel wool to remove rust from my knife?",
        answer:
          "I'd avoid it. Steel wool removes rust quickly but scratches the blade surface. Those scratches become initiation points for future rust. Stick with soft cloths, sponges, or dedicated rust erasers.",
      },
      {
        question: "Why does my stainless steel knife have rust?",
        answer:
          "Stainless steel resists rust — it's not rust-proof. Prolonged exposure to moisture, acidic foods, or salt can cause rust even on stainless blades. The same prevention rules apply: wash, dry immediately, store properly.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is a rusty knife dangerous to use?",
        answer:
          "Surface rust itself isn't toxic, but it indicates the knife isn't being properly maintained. Pitted rust can harbor bacteria. More practically, a rusty blade doesn't cut well and is harder to keep clean. Fix it or replace it.",
      },
      {
        question: "How long does rust removal take?",
        answer:
          "Depends on severity. Light surface rust with baking soda: about an hour. Moderate rust with vinegar: 1-4 hours. Heavily rusted blade: you might need multiple treatments over a day or two.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I prevent rust on carbon steel knives?",
        answer:
          "Yes, but it requires consistent care. Wash and dry immediately after every use. Apply a thin layer of food-grade mineral oil before storage. Some cooks develop a protective patina intentionally. Carbon steel rewards attention and punishes neglect.",
      },
      {
        question: "What's the fastest way to remove rust from a knife?",
        answer:
          "Bar Keeper's Friend works fastest — usually within minutes. But faster isn't always better. For valuable knives, I'd start with gentler methods like baking soda and only escalate if needed.",
