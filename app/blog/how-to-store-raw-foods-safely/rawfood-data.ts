        question: "What temperature should a refrigerator be for food safety?", answer: "Your refrigerator should be between 35°F and 38°F for optimal food safety. Most home refrigerators run too warm at 40-45°F. Use an appliance thermometer to verify, don't rely on the built-in display, which is often inaccurate."
      }, {
        question: "What is the temperature danger zone for food?", answer: "The temperature danger zone is between 40°F and 140°F. In this range, bacteria can double every 20 minutes. Raw foods left in this zone for more than 2 hours (1 hour if above 90°F) become unsafe to eat."
      }, {
        question: "Where should raw chicken be stored in the refrigerator?", answer: "Raw chicken must always be stored on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator. Poultry carries the highest contamination risk (Salmonella, Campylobacter), so it must be positioned where any drips cannot contaminate other foods below."
      }, {
        question: "How long can raw meat be stored in the refrigerator?", answer: "Ground meat and poultry: 1-2 days. Whole poultry: 1-2 days. Fish and seafood: 1-2 days. Beef, pork, and lamb steaks/chops/roasts: 3-5 days. If you won't use it within these times, freeze it immediately."
      }, {
        question: "What is the proper order for storing food in a refrigerator?", answer: "From top to bottom: ready-to-eat foods (leftovers, deli meats), then fish/seafood, then whole cuts of beef/pork/lamb, then ground meat, and raw poultry on the bottom. This hierarchy is based on minimum cooking temperatures required."
      }, {
        question: "How do you prevent cross-contamination in the refrigerator?", answer: "Store raw meats in sealed containers or on trays to catch drips. Follow the storage hierarchy with raw poultry on the bottom. Keep ready-to-eat foods on the top shelf. Label and date everything. Never store raw meat above prepared foods."
