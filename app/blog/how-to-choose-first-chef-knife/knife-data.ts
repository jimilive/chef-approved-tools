      "Most home cooks overthink knives. They chase fancy steel, exotic handles, or brands they saw on YouTube. And miss the fundamentals that actually matter: balance, geometry, and comfort."

    questions: [
      {
        question: "What's the best knife brand for beginners?", answer: "Victorinox Fibrox is my #1 recommendation, affordable, durable, and chef-approved. MAC and Mercer are great alternatives."
      }, {
        question: "What length chef knife should I buy?", answer: "8 inches works for almost everyone. Go 6 inches if you have smaller hands, 10 inches for large prep work."
      }, {
        question: "What's better, Japanese or German steel?", answer: "Japanese knives are harder and thinner (sharper but fragile). German knives are softer and more durable. Start with German-style balance."
      }, {
        question: "How often should I hone or sharpen?", answer: "Hone daily, sharpen every few months. Think of honing like brushing your teeth. It prevents damage before it happens."
      }, {
        question: "Should I buy a santoku instead?", answer: "Santoku knives are great for vegetables but lack the rock-chop motion of a Western chef knife. A chef knife is more versatile for beginners."
      }, {
        question: "What's the best cutting board for knives?", answer: "End-grain wood or thick NSF plastic. Avoid bamboo, glass, or granite."
      }, {
        question: "Is a more expensive knife always better?", answer: "No. An affordable knife that's properly maintained will outperform an expensive knife that's dull or poorly balanced. Maintenance and comfort matter more than price."
      }, {
        question: "Do I need different knives for different tasks?", answer: "Not at first. A single 8-inch chef knife handles 90% of kitchen tasks. Add specialty knives only after you've mastered your chef knife and identified specific needs."
