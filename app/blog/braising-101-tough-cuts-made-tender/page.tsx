const faqJsonLd = generateFAQSchema([
  {
    question: 'Can I braise in stainless steel instead of cast iron?',
    answer: 'Yes, but cast iron holds heat steadier. Stainless needs closer attention. Cast iron and enameled cast iron Dutch ovens maintain consistent temperature throughout the long cooking process, which creates more even results. Stainless steel works but requires more monitoring to prevent temperature swings that can toughen the meat.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I skip searing when braising?',
    answer: 'No. Searing develops flavor through Maillard browning—the foundation of the dish. The browned crust on the meat and the fond left in the pan create hundreds of flavor compounds that infuse the entire braise. Skipping this step leaves you with bland, one-dimensional results no amount of seasoning can fix.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long should a braise rest?',
    answer: 'At least 30 minutes. Ideally overnight. Resting allows the meat fibers to relax and reabsorb liquid, making them more tender and flavorful. Overnight rest also lets fat rise to the surface for easy removal and allows flavors to meld and deepen—this is why day-two braises taste better than fresh ones.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I braise without wine?',
    answer: 'Absolutely. Substitute tomato paste, vinegar, or stock for acidity. The wine&apos;s purpose is to add acidity and complexity—vinegar, citrus juice, tomatoes, or even beer accomplish the same goal. Choose your liquid based on the flavor profile you want: balsamic for sweetness, red wine vinegar for brightness, or beer for maltiness.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What&apos;s the difference between a braise and a stew?',
    answer: 'A braise partially submerges the meat; a stew covers it completely. Braising builds depth; stewing blends everything. Braises cook larger cuts partially submerged, creating concentrated flavor in both meat and sauce. Stews cook smaller pieces fully submerged, distributing flavor evenly throughout. Both are slow-cooked, but the technique and final texture differ.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What temperature should I braise at?',
    answer: 'Aim for 275°F in the oven or a gentle simmer (185-200°F internal) on the stovetop. This low temperature breaks down collagen into gelatin without tightening the muscle fibers. Too hot (over 212°F/boiling) and the meat toughens before the collagen converts. Too low and the collagen never fully breaks down. The sweet spot is that gentle, steady heat.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I know when my braise is done?',
    answer: 'The meat should be fork-tender—a fork should slide in and twist with minimal resistance. Cooking time varies by cut and size, but plan for 2½ to 3½ hours for most braises. Don&apos;t rely on time alone; check for tenderness. Undercooked braises are tough and chewy; properly cooked ones nearly fall apart.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I braise on the stovetop instead of the oven?',
    answer: 'Yes, but the oven provides more even, surrounding heat. Stovetop braising works if you maintain a very gentle simmer and monitor closely—the heat comes from below only, so you need to check periodically and adjust the burner. The oven surrounds the pot with consistent temperature, which creates more reliable results with less attention.'

            At Purple Café, we had a prep cook who was one of the best on the line—fast, sharp, cool under pressure. But one night, he tried to save time by leaving a braise running overnight. He set the burner too high, sealed the lid tight, and went home.
          </p>

          <p>
            The next morning, the kitchen smelled like burnt beef, panic, and bad decisions. We were one flare-up away from a fire report. He caught plenty of heat from the crew that day—from the oven and from us.
          </p>

          <p>
            That&apos;s the day I learned—and taught—that braising isn&apos;t about time, it&apos;s about control.

            What Braising Really Is
          </h2>

          <p>
            Braising is a chef&apos;s act of patience—a low, slow combination of dry and moist heat that transforms tough, connective meat into melt-in-your-mouth comfort.
          </p>

          <p>
            You start with a sear to develop flavor, then add liquid, cover, and let time and temperature do the heavy lifting.
          </p>

          <p>
            Every culture has its version—coq au vin, pot roast, birria, osso buco, short ribs—but the secret behind all of them is the same: controlled heat, full attention, and time measured in hours, not minutes.
          </p>

            The Science of Tenderness
          </h2>

          <p>
            Tough cuts—like chuck, shank, short rib, shoulder—are full of collagen and connective tissue.
          </p>

          <p>
            When you braise properly (250–300°F oven, or a gentle stovetop simmer), collagen converts into gelatin. That gelatin thickens the liquid and coats each fiber with luxurious texture.
          </p>

          <p>
            Too hot, and muscle fibers tighten before collagen melts. You get tough meat sitting in watery broth. Too cool, and the collagen never breaks down.
          </p>

          <p>
            The magic zone? 185–200°F internal temperature—right where connective tissue surrenders but the meat doesn&apos;t shred apart.
          </p>

            Step 1: Choose the Right Cut
          </h3>

          <p>
            Favor cuts from active muscles—shoulder, chuck, shank, or brisket. Fat marbling and connective tissue are your friends here.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">
            Step 2: Season Early
          </h3>

          <p>
            Salt your meat a few hours before cooking. It helps draw in flavor and keeps texture supple.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">
            Step 3: Sear, Don&apos;t Burn
          </h3>

          <p>
            Heat oil in a heavy pot like a Lodge Dutch Oven. Brown each side until deep golden crust forms. This builds the base flavor.
          </p>

            Step 5: Deglaze with Acid
          </h3>

          <p>
            Add red wine, vinegar, or even beer. Let it simmer to dissolve all the browned bits—the &quot;essence&quot; of your sear.

          <p>
            Add just enough stock to come halfway up the meat. Full submersion = stew, not braise.

            The Dutch oven is non-negotiable for braising. Cast iron or enameled cast iron distributes heat evenly and maintains steady temperature—critical for the long, slow cook that transforms tough cuts.

            Final Thoughts
          </h2>

          <p>
            Braising is the technique that teaches patience. You can&apos;t rush collagen breakdown, and you can&apos;t fake the depth of flavor that comes from proper searing and slow cooking.
          </p>

          <p>
            But when you get it right—when the meat falls apart at the touch of a fork and the sauce coats the back of a spoon—you understand why every professional kitchen has a braise on the menu.
          </p>

          <p>
            It&apos;s the kind of cooking that rewards attention, not speed. And that&apos;s exactly what makes it worth learning.

                Can I braise in stainless steel instead of cast iron?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                Yes, but cast iron holds heat steadier. Stainless needs closer attention. Cast iron and enameled cast iron Dutch ovens maintain consistent temperature throughout the long cooking process, which creates more even results. Stainless steel works but requires more monitoring to prevent temperature swings that can toughen the meat.

                Can I skip searing when braising?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                No. Searing develops flavor through Maillard browning—the foundation of the dish. The browned crust on the meat and the fond left in the pan create hundreds of flavor compounds that infuse the entire braise. Skipping this step leaves you with bland, one-dimensional results no amount of seasoning can fix.
              </p>

                How long should a braise rest?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                At least 30 minutes. Ideally overnight. Resting allows the meat fibers to relax and reabsorb liquid, making them more tender and flavorful. Overnight rest also lets fat rise to the surface for easy removal and allows flavors to meld and deepen—this is why day-two braises taste better than fresh ones.

                Can I braise without wine?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                Absolutely. Substitute tomato paste, vinegar, or stock for acidity. The wine&apos;s purpose is to add acidity and complexity—vinegar, citrus juice, tomatoes, or even beer accomplish the same goal. Choose your liquid based on the flavor profile you want: balsamic for sweetness, red wine vinegar for brightness, or beer for maltiness.

                What&apos;s the difference between a braise and a stew?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                A braise partially submerges the meat; a stew covers it completely. Braising builds depth; stewing blends everything. Braises cook larger cuts partially submerged, creating concentrated flavor in both meat and sauce. Stews cook smaller pieces fully submerged, distributing flavor evenly throughout. Both are slow-cooked, but the technique and final texture differ.

                What temperature should I braise at?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                Aim for 275°F in the oven or a gentle simmer (185-200°F internal) on the stovetop. This low temperature breaks down collagen into gelatin without tightening the muscle fibers. Too hot (over 212°F/boiling) and the meat toughens before the collagen converts. Too low and the collagen never fully breaks down. The sweet spot is that gentle, steady heat.

                How do I know when my braise is done?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                The meat should be fork-tender—a fork should slide in and twist with minimal resistance. Cooking time varies by cut and size, but plan for 2½ to 3½ hours for most braises. Don&apos;t rely on time alone; check for tenderness. Undercooked braises are tough and chewy; properly cooked ones nearly fall apart.

                Can I braise on the stovetop instead of the oven?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                Yes, but the oven provides more even, surrounding heat. Stovetop braising works if you maintain a very gentle simmer and monitor closely—the heat comes from below only, so you need to check periodically and adjust the burner. The oven surrounds the pot with consistent temperature, which creates more reliable results with less attention.
