      {
        question: "Why does freshly ground pepper taste better than pre-ground?",
        answer: "Black peppercorns contain volatile essential oils that begin evaporating immediately after grinding. Pre-ground pepper has lost most of these aromatic compounds during weeks or months of storage. Fresh grinding releases these oils directly onto your food, providing complex floral and woody notes instead of just harsh heat."
      },
      {
        question: "What grind size should I use for different dishes?",
        answer: "Use coarse grind for crusting steaks and finishing thick soups where you want bursts of pepper flavor. Medium grind works for most general cooking applications. Fine grind is best for light sauces, dressings, and when you want even pepper distribution without visible specks."
      },
      {
        question: "How long do whole peppercorns stay fresh?",
        answer: "Whole peppercorns maintain quality for years when stored properly in an airtight container away from light and heat. However, their aromatic oils gradually diminish over time. For optimal flavor, buy quantities you'll use within six months to a year."
      },
      {
        question: "What is the difference between black, white, and green peppercorns?",
        answer: "All come from the same plant but are processed differently. Black peppercorns are dried unripe berries with the most complex flavor. White peppercorns have the outer layer removed, providing cleaner heat for light-colored dishes. Green peppercorns are unripe and preserved, offering milder, fresher flavor."
      },
      {
        question: "What should I look for in a pepper mill?",
        answer: "Look for ceramic or hardened steel burrs that stay sharp indefinitely, adjustable coarseness settings, and consistent grind production. One-handed operation is valuable when cooking. Quality manual mills with ceramic mechanisms provide decades of reliable service."
      },
      {
        question: "When should I add pepper during cooking?",
        answer: "For dishes where pepper is a primary flavor (like cacio e pepe or steak au poivre), grind pepper immediately before serving. The volatile oils that create complex flavor evaporate quickly. For long-cooked dishes where pepper is a background note, adding earlier is acceptable."
