const faqJsonLd = generateFAQSchema([
  {
    question: 'Should knives touch wood in a block?',
    answer: 'Yes, but edge contact dulls—insert spine-side down if possible. Wood is softer than steel and won\'t damage blades if contact is minimal. However, repeated scraping against wood slots will microscopically deform the edge over time. The safest approach is to insert knives with the spine (back of the blade) resting in the slot, keeping the sharp edge away from contact.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How often should I oil my knives?',
    answer: 'Once a month for carbon steel; every few months for stainless. Carbon steel is more reactive and benefits from regular oiling to prevent rust and corrosion. Use food-grade mineral oil or camellia oil—never cooking oils, which go rancid. Stainless steel is more corrosion-resistant but still benefits from occasional oiling, especially in humid climates.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I hang knives near the stove?',
    answer: 'Avoid it. Steam and oil vapor corrode edges faster than you think. The constant temperature fluctuation and moisture from cooking accelerate oxidation, especially on high-carbon steel. Mount magnetic strips at least 3-4 feet away from the stove and sink to prevent exposure to heat, steam, and water splashes.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Why does my stainless steel knife have rust spots?',
    answer: 'Stainless isn\'t rust-proof—it\'s rust-resistant. Trapped moisture, salt exposure, or low-quality steel can still cause corrosion. The most common culprit is storing knives wet or in humid environments. Even stainless steel needs to be dried thoroughly after washing, especially around the bolster and handle rivets where water gets trapped.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I store knives in their original packaging?',
    answer: 'Short-term yes, long-term no. Boxes and plastic packaging trap moisture, which promotes rust and corrosion. If you have specialty knives you use infrequently, remove them from packaging, dry thoroughly, apply a light coat of mineral oil, and store in a breathable knife guard or roll. Check them every few months and re-oil as needed.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What\'s the best way to store carbon steel knives?',
    answer: 'Keep them extremely dry and lightly oiled. Carbon steel rusts much faster than stainless—even humidity in the air can cause oxidation. After washing and drying, apply a thin layer of food-grade mineral oil to the entire blade. Store in a low-humidity environment, preferably on a magnetic strip or in a well-ventilated drawer with guards. Never store carbon steel knives in leather sheaths long-term.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I remove rust from a knife blade?',
    answer: 'For light rust: make a paste with baking soda and water, gently rub with a wine cork or soft cloth, rinse, dry, and oil. For stubborn rust: use Bar Keeper\'s Friend or a rust eraser, working along the blade\'s length (not across). Severe rust may require professional restoration. Once removed, identify and fix the storage issue that caused it—usually trapped moisture.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Should wooden knife handles be oiled?',
    answer: 'Yes, wooden handles need periodic oiling to prevent cracking and splitting. Use food-grade mineral oil or cutting board oil every 4-6 weeks. Apply a small amount, let it soak in for 10 minutes, then wipe off excess. Never submerge wooden handles in water for extended periods, and always dry them immediately after washing. Cracked handles allow moisture to seep in, which can corrode the tang (the part of the blade inside the handle).'

            I&apos;ve had the same Victorinox chef&apos;s knife for nearly two decades. It&apos;s been sharpened, honed, and re-handled once—but it still slices like new. Why? Because I stored it right.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I trained at Seattle Central Culinary in the early &apos;90s, we were drilled on knife care as if our grades depended on it (they did). You never set a knife edge-down on stainless steel. You never tossed it into a sink. And you never stored it loose.

            By the end of this guide, you&apos;ll know how to store knives for decades—not months—without fancy equipment or complicated systems.

            The Problem: Why Knives Dull and Rust in Storage
          </h2>

          <p>
            Knife damage doesn&apos;t just happen while cutting—it happens while sitting. The biggest culprits:
          </p>

          <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-600 p-6 my-8">
            <ul className="space-y-2 mb-0">
              <li><strong>Moisture trapped under handles or in blocks:</strong> Creates corrosion at the bolster and tang</li>
              <li><strong>Metal-to-metal contact in drawers:</strong> Microscopically chips and deforms edges</li>
              <li><strong>Acidic residues left from food:</strong> Accelerates oxidation, especially on carbon steel</li>
              <li><strong>Humidity in the air:</strong> Causes rust even on knives that appear dry</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>
            Most home cooks assume dull knives are from use. In reality, improper storage dulls more knives than cooking ever will. Professionals avoid this by controlling three things: dryness, separation, and airflow.
          </p>

          <p>
            I once worked with a line cook who kept his knives in a leather roll—seemed professional, right? After six months in a humid Seattle kitchen, his carbon steel chef&apos;s knife had rust blooms all along the edge. The leather had trapped moisture against the blade every single night. Cost him $200 to have it professionally restored.

            The Professional Method: Knife Storage for the Long Haul

            1. Dry Immediately and Thoroughly
          </h3>

          <p>
            Never leave knives in the dish rack. After washing, dry completely—especially the bolster (the thick junction where blade meets handle) and handle rivets.
          </p>

          <p>
            Water trapped in these crevices is invisible but devastating. It sits against the steel for hours, corroding from the inside out. I use a clean dish towel to dry the blade, then a paper towel corner to wick moisture from the rivets and bolster joint.
          </p>

          <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-600 p-6 my-8">

            2. Separate Blades from Contact
          </h3>

          <p>
            Use a magnetic strip or drawer insert so edges never touch metal, wood, or other knives. Even fine contact deforms micro-edges invisible to the naked eye.
          </p>

          <p>
            Professional kitchens don&apos;t use knife blocks for active service—they use wall-mounted magnetic strips or knife rolls where each blade has its own protected slot. This isn&apos;t about aesthetics; it&apos;s about preservation.

            3. Control Humidity and Airflow
          </h3>

          <p>
            If you live near the coast or in a humid climate, humidity can corrode blades even inside blocks. Wipe knives with food-safe mineral oil once a month.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I moved from Montana (dry) to Seattle (wet), I learned this lesson fast. Knives I&apos;d stored for years without issue suddenly developed surface rust within weeks. The solution: a thin coating of mineral oil creates a barrier against moisture.
          </p>

            4. Protect Knives During Travel and Storage
          </h3>

          <p>
            If you cater, camp, or travel with knives, use a knife roll or individual blade guards. I&apos;ve used plastic edge guards for 10+ years—they cost a few bucks and prevent hundreds in damage.
          </p>

          <p>
            Blade guards are cheap insurance. They protect edges from contact, prevent accidental cuts when reaching into bags, and allow safe drawer storage even without an insert.
          </p>

          <div className="bg-orange-50 border-l-4 border-orange-600 p-6 my-8">
            <p className="font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-2">Pro Tip:</p>
            <p className="mb-0">
              Never store carbon-steel knives in leather sheaths long-term. Leather traps moisture and accelerates rust. Use breathable blade guards or a canvas knife roll instead.

            Common Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)
          </h2>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">
            Mistake #1: Storing Knives Wet
          </h3>

          <p>
            Even &quot;stainless&quot; steel will corrode. Always towel dry before storage, then let air dry for 2-3 minutes to ensure complete dryness.
          </p>

          <p>
            I&apos;ve seen $300 Japanese knives ruined by this single mistake. The owner washed them, dried them &quot;mostly,&quot; then put them straight into a wooden block. Six months later, rust had formed inside the block slots and spread to the blade.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">
            Mistake #2: Putting Knives in the Dishwasher
          </h3>

          <p>
            The heat warps handles, the detergent corrodes steel, and the spray dulls edges by bouncing knives against racks and other items. Hand wash only, every time.
          </p>

          <p>
            Dishwashers subject knives to extreme temperature swings (cold to 140°F+), caustic chemicals, and violent water jets. Wooden handles crack, rivets loosen, and edges get microscopic chips from contact with other utensils.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">
            Mistake #3: Using Tight Plastic Sheaths Without Airflow
          </h3>

          <p>
            If there&apos;s no airflow, condensation builds inside the sheath. Use breathable guards with ventilation holes, or remove sheaths when storing at home.
          </p>

          <p>
            Plastic sheaths are fine for transport but terrible for long-term storage. They trap any residual moisture against the blade, creating a perfect environment for corrosion.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">
            Mistake #4: Ignoring the Handle
          </h3>

          <p>
            Wooden handles need care too. Dry them thoroughly and oil every 4-6 weeks with mineral oil or cutting board conditioner. Cracked handles allow moisture to reach the tang (the part of the blade inside the handle), causing hidden corrosion.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-6 mb-3">
            Mistake #5: Storing Knives Near Heat or Moisture Sources
          </h3>

          <p>
            Don&apos;t store knives above the stove, near the sink, or above the dishwasher. Steam, heat, and splashes all accelerate corrosion and can warp handles. Choose a cool, dry location away from water and heat.

            Final Thoughts
          </h2>

          <p>
            Knife storage isn&apos;t glamorous, but it&apos;s the difference between knives that last two years and knives that last twenty. The principles are simple: keep them dry, keep them separated, and protect them from humidity.
          </p>

          <p>
            You don&apos;t need expensive equipment—just consistent habits. Dry thoroughly after every wash. Store with proper separation. Oil monthly if you have carbon steel or live in a humid climate. That&apos;s it.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Victorinox chef&apos;s knife I mentioned at the start? I bought it in 2006 for $40. It&apos;s been sharpened dozens of times, honed hundreds, and used for tens of thousands of cuts. It still performs like new because I&apos;ve stored it the same way since day one.
          </p>

          <p>
            That&apos;s the power of proper storage. It turns a $40 knife into a lifetime tool.

                Should knives touch wood in a block?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                Yes, but edge contact dulls—insert spine-side down if possible. Wood is softer than steel and won&apos;t damage blades if contact is minimal. However, repeated scraping against wood slots will microscopically deform the edge over time. The safest approach is to insert knives with the spine (back of the blade) resting in the slot, keeping the sharp edge away from contact.
              </p>

                How often should I oil my knives?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                Once a month for carbon steel; every few months for stainless. Carbon steel is more reactive and benefits from regular oiling to prevent rust and corrosion. Use food-grade mineral oil or camellia oil—never cooking oils, which go rancid. Stainless steel is more corrosion-resistant but still benefits from occasional oiling, especially in humid climates.
              </p>
            </div>

                Can I hang knives near the stove?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                Avoid it. Steam and oil vapor corrode edges faster than you think. The constant temperature fluctuation and moisture from cooking accelerate oxidation, especially on high-carbon steel. Mount magnetic strips at least 3-4 feet away from the stove and sink to prevent exposure to heat, steam, and water splashes.

                Why does my stainless steel knife have rust spots?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                Stainless isn&apos;t rust-proof—it&apos;s rust-resistant. Trapped moisture, salt exposure, or low-quality steel can still cause corrosion. The most common culprit is storing knives wet or in humid environments. Even stainless steel needs to be dried thoroughly after washing, especially around the bolster and handle rivets where water gets trapped.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-2">
                Can I store knives in their original packaging?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                Short-term yes, long-term no. Boxes and plastic packaging trap moisture, which promotes rust and corrosion. If you have specialty knives you use infrequently, remove them from packaging, dry thoroughly, apply a light coat of mineral oil, and store in a breathable knife guard or roll. Check them every few months and re-oil as needed.

                What&apos;s the best way to store carbon steel knives?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                Keep them extremely dry and lightly oiled. Carbon steel rusts much faster than stainless—even humidity in the air can cause oxidation. After washing and drying, apply a thin layer of food-grade mineral oil to the entire blade. Store in a low-humidity environment, preferably on a magnetic strip or in a well-ventilated drawer with guards. Never store carbon steel knives in leather sheaths long-term.

                How do I remove rust from a knife blade?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                For light rust: make a paste with baking soda and water, gently rub with a wine cork or soft cloth, rinse, dry, and oil. For stubborn rust: use Bar Keeper&apos;s Friend or a rust eraser, working along the blade&apos;s length (not across). Severe rust may require professional restoration. Once removed, identify and fix the storage issue that caused it—usually trapped moisture.

                Should wooden knife handles be oiled?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-slate-700">
                Yes, wooden handles need periodic oiling to prevent cracking and splitting. Use food-grade mineral oil or cutting board oil every 4-6 weeks. Apply a small amount, let it soak in for 10 minutes, then wipe off excess. Never submerge wooden handles in water for extended periods, and always dry them immediately after washing. Cracked handles allow moisture to seep in, which can corrode the tang (the part of the blade inside the handle).
