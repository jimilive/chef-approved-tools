        question: "What temperature should I use for sheet pan roasting?", answer: "425°F-475°F is the professional range for most vegetables and proteins. This high heat creates proper caramelization and prevents steaming. Lower temperatures (under 400°F) typically result in soggy, pale food instead of crisp, browned results."
      }, {
        question: "Why does food steam instead of roast on my sheet pan?", answer: "Overcrowding is the most common cause. When food touches or overlaps, moisture gets trapped and creates steam instead of evaporating. Leave space between pieces, about ½ inch for vegetables, more for proteins. If you can't fit everything with proper spacing, use two pans."
      }, {
        question: "Do I need parchment paper for sheet pan cooking?", answer: "Parchment paper is optional but helpful for cleanup and preventing sticking with delicate items like fish. However, direct metal contact creates better browning and caramelization. For maximum crust and color, skip the parchment and oil the pan directly."
      }, {
        question: "Should I preheat my sheet pan?", answer: "Preheating is beneficial for proteins and when you want maximum crust from the start. For vegetables, it's optional, a cold pan works fine and is safer to handle. Preheating does reduce overall cooking time slightly and creates more even browning."
      }, {
        question: "What's the best way to clean a sheet pan after high-heat roasting?", answer: "Let the pan cool completely, then use Bar Keeper's Friend and a non-scratch scrubber for burnt-on residue. For stuck-on bits, make a paste with baking soda and water, let it sit for 15 minutes, then scrub. Avoid putting hot pans in water. Thermal shock can warp them."
      }, {
        question: "Can I cook different foods on the same sheet pan?", answer: "Yes, but group foods by cooking time and temperature needs. Put slower-cooking items (like potatoes) on the pan first, then add faster items (like asparagus) partway through. Keep proteins separate from vegetables if they release a lot of liquid, which can prevent browning."
      }, {
        question: "What's the difference between a sheet pan and a cookie sheet?", answer: "Sheet pans (also called half-sheet pans or jelly roll pans) have raised edges on all four sides, making them ideal for roasting vegetables, proteins, and anything with liquid. Cookie sheets have one or no raised edges for easy sliding of cookies. For versatile cooking, choose sheet pans with 1-inch raised edges."
      }, {
        question: "How do I prevent my sheet pan from warping in the oven?", answer: "Use heavy-gauge aluminum pans (13-gauge or thicker) that resist warping at high temperatures. Avoid extreme temperature changes, never put a cold pan in a hot oven or run hot pans under cold water. Quality pans like commercial-grade sheet pans handle thermal stress much better than thin, cheap versions."
