      {
        question: "Can I roast frozen vegetables?",
        answer: "Yes, but results are inferior to fresh. Pat dry to remove ice crystals, increase roasting time by 10 minutes, and expect less crispy texture due to higher water content. Roast hotter (450°F) and longer."
      },
      {
        question: "Why do my vegetables burn on the outside but stay raw inside?",
        answer: "Cut size too large for temperature/time, or oven running too hot. Either cut smaller or lower temp to 400°F."
      },
      {
        question: "How do I make vegetables extra crispy?",
        answer: "Higher heat (450°F), less crowding, thorough drying before roasting, and don't stir too often. These four factors create maximum crispiness."
      },
      {
        question: "Should I line my pans with parchment?",
        answer: "Yes, for delicate veggies. For maximum browning, go bare pan. Parchment prevents sticking but can reduce caramelization slightly."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I roast multiple types at once?",
        answer: "Yes — group by cooking time. Add quick-cooking ones later. Start with dense vegetables like carrots and potatoes, then add faster-cooking vegetables like zucchini near the end."
      },
      {
        question: "Why does restaurant-roasted food taste better?",
        answer: "Higher heat, better airflow, and confident seasoning. Restaurants use professional sheet pans with excellent heat distribution, maintain proper spacing, and season aggressively."
      },
      {
        question: "How do I reheat roasted vegetables?",
        answer: "Skip the microwave. Use a 400°F oven for 5–7 minutes to restore texture. Microwaving makes them soggy."
      },
      {
        question: "What oil is best for roasting vegetables?",
        answer: "High smoke point oils work best: avocado oil (520°F), grapeseed oil (420°F), or light olive oil (465°F). Extra virgin olive oil can burn at 425°F."
      },
      {
        question: "Should I salt before or after roasting?",
        answer: "Always salt before roasting. Salt draws moisture to the surface, which evaporates during cooking and concentrates flavor. Waiting until after means the seasoning sits on top instead of penetrating."
      },
      {
        question: "Why are my vegetables cooking unevenly?",
        answer: "Most home ovens have hot spots. Rotate your pan 180 degrees halfway through cooking. Also check that pieces are cut to uniform size — variance in size creates variance in cooking time."
