    introduction: [
      "The wood versus composite cutting board debate has been ongoing in professional kitchens for decades. Both materials have distinct advantages: wood boards offer superior knife feel and natural antibacterial properties, while composite boards provide bulletproof sanitation and commercial dishwasher durability.",
      "The truth? Neither is universally \"better\"—they excel at different things. Your choice depends on your priorities: traditional craftsmanship and knife care versus modern convenience and strict hygiene protocols.",
      "This comprehensive comparison breaks down everything that matters: material science, knife edge preservation, sanitation research, maintenance requirements, durability testing, and real-world performance in both home and professional settings."

When your knife cuts into the surface, it slips between the fibers rather than severing them. This \"self-healing\" property is why end-grain boards last decades.",

            "However, the difference matters more to professionals using knives 6+ hours daily than home cooks cutting for 30-45 minutes. If you sharpen your knives twice yearly (typical for home use), you likely won't notice composite's edge impact.",
            "**The Counterargument:** Composite boards stay flat forever. Wood boards can warp or cup if improperly maintained, creating uneven surfaces that damage knife edges worse than any material hardness issue. A warped wood board is far more destructive than a perfectly flat composite board."

Bacteria penetrate the surface but then die within minutes—likely due to wood's tendency to pull moisture from bacteria cells. The same bacteria thrived for hours on plastic and composite surfaces.",
            "His testing used Salmonella, E. coli, and Listeria (the three most dangerous food pathogens). Within 3 minutes on wood, 99.9% of bacteria were dead. On plastic and composite, they survived—and multiplied—for hours.",
            "**The Critical Caveat:** This applies to properly maintained, minimally scarred wood boards. Once deep knife cuts create grooves, bacteria hide in those crevices. Wood's antibacterial properties can't reach them. This is why health departments often prohibit wood boards in commercial kitchens—not because wood is inherently less sanitary, but because ensuring proper maintenance is difficult to regulate."

    questions: [
      {
        question: "Can I use both wood and composite cutting boards?",
        answer: "Absolutely! Many professional and home kitchens use both. A common strategy is to use composite boards for raw meat (for easy dishwasher sanitation) and wood boards for vegetables, bread, and cooked foods (for superior knife feel). This gives you the advantages of both materials."
      },
      {
        question: "Are wood cutting boards really antibacterial?",
        answer: "Yes, according to UC Davis research by Dr. Dean Cliver. Wood's natural properties cause bacteria to penetrate the surface and then die within minutes. However, this applies to properly maintained boards without deep grooves. Once a wood board develops significant knife scarring, bacteria can hide in those grooves where wood's antibacterial properties can't reach them."
      },
      {
        question: "How often do I need to oil a wood cutting board?",
        answer: "For regular home use, oil your wood board once a month. If you notice the wood looking dry or lighter in color, that's a sign it needs oiling. Professional kitchens with heavy daily use may oil weekly. Use food-grade mineral oil or a specialized cutting board conditioner (often a blend of mineral oil and beeswax)."
      },
      {
        question: "Can composite boards go in the dishwasher?",
        answer: "Yes, most composite boards (like Epicurean) are specifically designed for dishwasher use, both commercial and home dishwashers. This is one of their primary advantages. Check manufacturer specifications, but most composite boards are heat-resistant to 350°F and dishwasher-safe."
      },

        question: "Do wood boards dull knives faster than composite?",
        answer: "No, the opposite is true. Wood boards (especially end-grain) are gentler on knife edges than composite boards. Composite materials are 2-3x harder than maple wood, which causes faster edge dulling. Professional kitchens using composite boards typically sharpen knives more frequently than those using wood boards."

        question: "How do I remove stains from a wood cutting board?",
        answer: "For surface stains, scrub with coarse salt and lemon juice, let sit for 5-10 minutes, then rinse. For deeper stains, make a paste of baking soda and water, apply to the stain, let sit for several hours, then scrub and rinse. For very stubborn stains, light sanding with fine-grit sandpaper can remove the stained layer."

        question: "Which type is better for raw meat?",
        answer: "Composite boards are generally preferred for raw meat because they can be sanitized in a dishwasher at 180°F. While wood has natural antibacterial properties, the ability to dishwasher-sanitize composite boards provides extra peace of mind and meets commercial food safety standards."

        question: "Can a warped wood board be fixed?",
        answer: "Sometimes. For mild warping, thoroughly wet the board, weight it down flat on both sides, and let it dry slowly (can take several days). Then resume regular oiling to prevent future warping. Severe warping usually can't be fixed at home, but professional resurfacing can sometimes salvage the board."
