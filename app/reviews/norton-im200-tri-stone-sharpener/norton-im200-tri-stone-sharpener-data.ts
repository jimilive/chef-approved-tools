  testingStory: {
    title: "The 6-Year Purple Café Testing Story",
    paragraphs: [
      "For 6 years at Purple Café, the Norton Tri-Stone kept our <LINK>Victorinox chef knives</LINK> and other professional cutlery performing at peak sharpness through 200+ cover nights. This wasn't equipment tucked away in a drawer for occasional use—this was a critical maintenance tool that saw weekly action in a demanding commercial environment.",
      "Every Saturday morning before weekend service, I'd sharpen 8-12 knives: chef knives, paring knives, boning knives, bread knives. Each knife got the full three-stone treatment, progressing from coarse through medium to fine. By the time prep started, every blade was razor-sharp and ready for 48 hours of continuous service.",
      "Sharp knives were as critical to our operation as our <LINK>KitchenAid commercial mixer</LINK> and <LINK>Robot Coupe food processor</LINK>—equipment that simply cannot fail. In a professional kitchen running 200+ covers on weekend nights, a dull knife isn't just inconvenient—it slows service, compromises safety, and costs money.",
      "The Norton Tri-Stone never failed. Over 6 years of weekly sharpening sessions (300+ total sharpening sessions on dozens of different knives), the stones maintained their cutting effectiveness without significant wear. The non-slip base never budged on our stainless steel prep tables. The three-stage progression consistently delivered professional-quality edges."

  // SECTION 5: THREE-STONE PROGRESSIVE SYSTEM
  threeStoneSystem: {
    title: "Understanding the Three-Stone Progressive System",
    intro: "The genius of the Norton Tri-Stone is its three-stage progressive design. Instead of guessing which single stone to buy or switching between multiple separate stones, everything you need is mounted in one system.",
    stages: [
      {
        title: "Stage 1: Coarse Stone (120 Grit)",
        purpose: "Repair damaged edges, establish initial bevel, remove chips or rolls.",
        description: "This is your heavy-lifting stone. When a knife is truly dull—the edge rolled over, visible damage, hasn't been sharpened in months—you start here. The coarse stone aggressively removes metal to create a new edge geometry. In professional use, I'd spend 5-10 passes per side on this stone for knives in poor condition.",
        whenToUse: "Badly dulled knives, edge repairs, establishing bevels on new knives.",
        whenToSkip: "Knives that just need touch-ups can skip straight to medium or fine."
      },
      {
        title: "Stage 2: Medium Stone (280 Grit)",
        purpose: "Refine edge, remove coarse stone scratches, develop working sharpness.",
        description: "This is where most of your sharpening time is spent. The medium stone refines the rough edge from the coarse stone and brings the knife to good working sharpness. For knives in decent condition that just need regular maintenance, you start here and skip the coarse stone entirely.",
        note: "In professional use, I'd do 8-12 passes per side on this stone for regular weekly maintenance. After the medium stone, a knife is already sharp enough for most kitchen tasks."
      },
      {
        title: "Stage 3: Fine Stone (320 Grit)",
        purpose: "Polish edge to razor-sharp finish, remove micro-scratches, maximize cutting performance.",
        description: "The fine stone is your finishing stone. It polishes the edge created by the medium stone to maximum sharpness—the difference between \"sharp enough to work\" and \"paper-slicing razor-sharp.\" This is the stone that creates the mirror-polished edge you see on professional kitchen knives.",
        note: "I'd spend 10-15 passes per side on the fine stone, using progressively lighter pressure for the final passes. After this stage, knives would slice paper cleanly, shave arm hair, and glide through tomato skin with zero pressure."
      }
    ]
  },

  // SECTION 6: PROFESSIONAL TECHNIQUE
  professionalTechnique: {
    title: "Professional Sharpening Technique",
    intro: "The difference between a properly sharpened knife and a dull one is the difference between working with our <LINK>premium John Boos cutting board</LINK> versus a cheap plastic one—night and day. Here's the technique I developed over 6 years of professional sharpening:",
    techniques: [
      {
        title: "The 20-Degree Angle Rule",
        paragraphs: [
          "Most kitchen knives sharpen at 20 degrees per side (40 degrees inclusive). This is the sweet spot between edge durability and cutting performance. To visualize 20 degrees, imagine the knife spine lifted about 1/3 of the blade width off the stone.",
          "Critical: Consistency matters more than perfection. A consistent 22-degree angle produces better results than varying between 15 and 25 degrees trying to hit exactly 20 degrees."
        ]
      },
      {
        title: "Light Pressure, Multiple Passes",
        paragraphs: [
          "Beginners often use too much pressure. The Norton stones cut effectively with moderate pressure—you're not trying to force metal removal, you're guiding it. I use firm but controlled pressure, about the same force you'd use writing with a marker.",
          "Multiple light passes beat fewer heavy passes. Heavy pressure creates heat, which can affect edge temper on high-carbon knives. Light, consistent pressure produces cleaner edges and extends stone life."
        ]
      },
      {
        title: "The Burr Test",
        paragraphs: [
          "After sharpening one side, feel the opposite edge with your thumb (perpendicular to the edge, not along it). You should feel a slight burr—a tiny raised wire of metal that indicates you've sharpened all the way to the edge. Once you feel the burr along the entire edge, flip the knife and sharpen the other side until you raise a burr there too.",
          "The burr is your confirmation that you're sharpening effectively. No burr means you haven't reached the edge yet—keep going."
        ]
      },
      {
        title: "Oil vs Water",
        intro: "The Norton IM200 works with either light mineral oil or water. In 6 years of professional use, I exclusively used light mineral oil for these reasons:",
        reasons: [
          "Prevents rust on carbon steel knives",
          "Suspends metal particles better, preventing stone loading",
          "No pre-soaking required—ready to sharpen immediately",
          "Creates smoother sharpening action",
          "Easier cleanup with paper towels"
        ],
        outro: "Use just enough oil to create a thin film on the stone surface. More isn't better—excessive oil makes a mess without improving sharpening."

  // SECTION 7: WHY MANUAL STONES BEAT ELECTRIC
  manualVsElectric: {
    title: "Why Manual Stones Beat Electric Sharpeners in Professional Kitchens",
    intro: "Purple Café could have bought electric sharpeners. We chose manual stones for good reasons:",
    reasons: [
      {
        title: "Complete Control",
        description: "Manual sharpening gives you control over every variable: angle, pressure, number of passes, which areas of the edge get more attention. Electric sharpeners lock you into fixed angles and predetermined aggression. For maintaining professional kitchen knives—some German (20-22 degrees), some Japanese (15-17 degrees), some specialty knives with unique geometries—manual stones adapt to anything."
      },
      {
        title: "Minimal Metal Removal",
        paragraphs: [
          "Good knives represent significant investment. Electric sharpeners remove metal aggressively—they have to, because they're optimized for speed. A <LINK>$50 Victorinox chef knife</LINK> sharpened weekly on an electric sharpener might last 3-5 years before wearing down to nothing. The same knife sharpened manually on stones can last 10-15 years.",
          "Manual stones remove only what's necessary to restore sharpness. This preservation of blade life matters when you're maintaining a dozen professional knives."
        ]
      },
      {
        title: "Superior Edge Quality",
        paragraphs: [
          "A properly hand-sharpened edge is smoother, more refined, and stays sharp longer than electric-sharpened edges. Electric sharpeners create micro-serrations that feel sharp initially but dull faster. Manual stones create clean, polished edges that maintain cutting performance through longer service periods.",
          "In a professional kitchen, longer-lasting sharpness means less frequent sharpening, which means less downtime and better service consistency."
        ]
      },
      {
        title: "Zero Moving Parts to Break",
        paragraphs: [
          "The Norton Tri-Stone is three aluminum oxide stones mounted in a plastic case with a rubber base. There are no motors, no belts, no electronics, nothing to fail. After 6 years of professional use, the only wear was gradual stone surface reduction—exactly what you expect and want.",
          "Electric sharpeners have motors that burn out, abrasive wheels that need replacement, and electronics that fail. In commercial kitchens where equipment gets used hard, simplicity and durability matter."

          "Dry completely before use"
        ],
        note: "In 6 years of professional use, I deep-cleaned the Norton stones 3-4 times total. Proper post-use cleaning prevents most loading issues."

      {
        title: "Flattening Stones",
        intro: "With extended use, sharpening stones develop slight concave wear in the center (where most sharpening occurs). When the center is noticeably lower than the ends, flatten the stone:",
        steps: [
          "Use diamond flattening plate (ideal method)",
          "Or use 220-grit wet/dry sandpaper on flat glass surface",
          "Rub stone in circular motion until surface is uniformly flat",
          "Clean thoroughly after flattening"
        ],
        note: "After 6 years of weekly professional use, my Norton stones showed minimal dish wear. Home users might go 5-10 years before needing to flatten stones."

    paragraphs: [
      "Here's the reality: if the Norton Tri-Stone survived 6 years of weekly professional use sharpening 8-12 knives in a 200+ cover restaurant, it'll serve the average home cook for decades.",
      "Most home cooks sharpen 2-4 knives monthly at most. That's maybe 50 sharpening sessions per year versus the 300+ sessions I put this system through over 6 years. At home usage rates, this sharpener could easily last 20-30 years.",
      "The cost-per-sharpening becomes essentially zero. Professional sharpening services charge anywhere from reasonable to expensive per knife. After 10-20 uses, the Norton has paid for itself compared to professional services.",
      "This sharpener belongs in every serious home cook's <LINK>professional kitchen starter kit</LINK>. It's the difference between maintaining your knives at professional standards versus accepting progressively duller edges until you finally pay someone else to sharpen them.",

    title: "Frequently Asked Questions About Norton Tri-Stone Sharpener",
    items: [
      {
        question: "Is the Norton Tri-Stone sharpener worth it?",
        answer: "After 6 years of professional kitchen use maintaining 8-12 knives weekly, absolutely yes. The three-stage progressive system (coarse/medium/fine) delivers restaurant-quality results that rival sharpening services costing substantially more. For serious home cooks maintaining multiple knives, this pays for itself quickly compared to professional sharpening services. The Norton lasted 6 years in demanding commercial conditions—it'll last decades in home use."
      },
      {
        question: "How do you use the Norton IM200 Tri-Stone?",
        answer: "Progressive three-stage process: 1) Coarse (120 grit): Repair damaged edges, establish bevel (5-10 passes per side), 2) Medium (280 grit): Refine edge, remove coarse scratches (8-12 passes per side), 3) Fine (320 grit): Polish to razor-sharp finish (10-15 passes per side). Maintain consistent 20-degree angle. Use light pressure. The stones cut effectively without aggressive force."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you need oil or water with Norton Tri-Stone?",
        answer: "The Norton IM200 can be used with light mineral oil OR water. In 6 years of professional use, I used light mineral oil exclusively. Why oil works better: Prevents rust on carbon steel knives, suspends metal particles better than water, stones don't require pre-soaking, creates smoother sharpening action. Use just enough to create thin film on stone surface. Excessive oil isn't better."
      },
      {
        question: "How long does the Norton Tri-Stone last?",
        answer: "With proper care, 10-20 years for home use. Mine lasted 6 years of weekly professional use (300+ sharpening sessions) with minimal wear. Norton's aluminum oxide abrasive maintains cutting ability far longer than cheap stones that glaze over quickly. The stones will wear down gradually but remain effective. When surface becomes uneven, flatten with diamond plate or coarse sandpaper on glass."
      },
      {
        question: "What's the difference between Norton Tri-Stone and single stones?",
        answer: "The Tri-Stone provides complete sharpening progression in one system. Benefits over buying individual stones: Cost (three quality stones for less than premium singles cost separately), Convenience (no switching stones or setups mid-sharpening), Consistency (all three stones mounted in one base maintains alignment), Space (takes up 1/3 the storage space of three individual stones). For serious sharpening, individual Japanese water stones offer finer grits. But for maintaining kitchen knives to professional standards, the Tri-Stone is ideal."
      },
      {
        question: "Can beginners use the Norton Tri-Stone?",
        answer: "Yes, but expect a learning curve. Manual sharpening requires developing muscle memory for consistent angles. Benefits for beginners: Three grits eliminate guesswork about which stone to use, non-slip base provides stability while learning, forgiving stones that cut effectively without excessive pressure, visual feedback—you can see the edge developing. Realistic timeline: 3-5 practice sessions to develop decent technique. 10-15 sessions to achieve consistently sharp results. Worth the investment—this skill lasts a lifetime."
      },
      {
        question: "How do you clean Norton sharpening stones?",
        answer: "Simple maintenance after each use: 1) Wipe stones with paper towel to remove metal particles and oil, 2) If using water, rinse stones thoroughly, 3) Dry completely before storing, 4) Store in dry location. Deep cleaning (monthly): Scrub with dish soap and stiff brush, rinse thoroughly, dry completely. If stones become loaded with metal particles, soak in mineral spirits overnight, scrub, rinse, dry. Proper cleaning maintains cutting effectiveness and extends stone life."
      },
      {
        question: "Norton Tri-Stone vs electric sharpener: which is better?",
        answer: "Different tools for different priorities. Norton Tri-Stone advantages: Complete control over angle and pressure, removes minimal metal (knives last longer), can repair damaged edges effectively, works with any knife style or size, no moving parts to break. Electric sharpener advantages: Faster (2-3 minutes vs 10-15 minutes), consistent angles automatically, easier for beginners. After 6 years in professional kitchen, I chose manual stones. Better edge quality, more control, longer knife lifespan."
