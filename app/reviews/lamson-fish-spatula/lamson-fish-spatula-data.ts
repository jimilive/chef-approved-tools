        title: 'Why a Fish Spatula Is Different',
        content: 'A fish spatula (also called a fish turner or slotted turner) is a specialized tool designed for one purpose: sliding under delicate foods without breaking them. The thin, flexible, slotted blade distinguishes it from regular spatulas. The slots allow oil and liquid to drain away, while the beveled edge slides effortlessly under fish fillets, eggs, and other fragile items that would stick to or break with a standard spatula.'
      },
      {
        title: 'Professional Kitchen Performance',
        content: 'I bought this exact Lamson fish spatula in 2009 and used it professionally at Purple Café (2009-2012) for fish service. The high-carbon stainless steel blade has the ideal flex, enough to conform to the curve of a pan, but enough rigidity to support a full salmon fillet. The slotted design drains oil perfectly, preventing soggy fish skin. After 17 years of ownership, it still performs like new.'
      },
      {
        title: 'Beyond Fish: Everyday Versatility',
        content: 'Despite the name, this fish turner handles far more than fish. I reach for it whenever I need to flip something delicate: eggs over easy, latkes, delicate pancakes, even cookies from a baking sheet. The thin edge slides under food that would stick to a thicker spatula, and the flexibility lets you scoop and flip in one confident motion.'
      },
      {
        title: 'Why Lamson Stands Out',
        content: 'The Lamson fish spatula is made in Shelburne Falls, Massachusetts, the same town where they\'ve been making cutlery since 1837. The high-carbon stainless steel holds up to professional abuse, the POM handle stays comfortable during long prep sessions, and the three-rivet construction won\'t loosen over time. This is a fish spatula built for decades of use.'

    title: 'Stainless Steel vs Silicone Fish Spatulas',
    sections: [
      {
        title: 'Why Stainless Steel Wins for Most Tasks',
        content: 'When it comes to fish spatulas, stainless steel beats silicone for nearly every task. The thin metal edge slides under food that silicone can\'t reach, and the rigidity supports heavier items like salmon fillets. Metal fish spatulas also tolerate higher heat without warping or melting.'
      },
      {
        title: 'When Silicone Makes Sense',
        content: 'If you exclusively use nonstick cookware, a silicone fish spatula protects your coating. But for cast iron, stainless steel pans, or the grill, a metal fish spatula like the Lamson is the right tool. The beveled edge creates the clean release that delicate foods demand.'
      },
      {
        title: 'The Flexibility Factor',
        content: 'The Lamson hits the sweet spot: flexible enough to conform to curved pan surfaces, rigid enough to support a full fillet without folding. Some cheaper metal fish spatulas are too stiff or too floppy. The Lamson\'s high-carbon stainless steel provides professional-grade flex.'

  // SECTION: LEFT-HANDED (KD 1 KEYWORD!)
  leftHandedSection: {
    title: 'Left-Handed Fish Spatula Option',
    paragraphs: [
      'Here\'s something most fish spatula reviews miss: handedness matters. The beveled edge on a fish spatula is angled to slide under food from a specific direction. If you\'re left-handed and using a right-handed spatula, you\'re working against the tool\'s design.',
      'Lamson makes a left-handed fish spatula, one of the only manufacturers to offer this option. The beveled edge is reversed, so left-handed cooks get the same effortless sliding action that right-handers enjoy. If you\'ve ever wondered why fish spatulas felt awkward, this might be why.',
      'The left-handed Lamson has identical construction: high-carbon stainless steel, POM handle, three-rivet assembly, made in USA. The only difference is the bevel orientation.'

  // FAQ SCHEMA DATA

    {
      question: 'What is a fish spatula?',
      answer: 'A fish spatula (also called a fish turner or slotted turner) is a specialized kitchen tool with a thin, flexible, slotted metal blade designed to slide under delicate foods like fish fillets, eggs, and pancakes. The slots allow oil and liquid to drain, and the thin beveled edge prevents tearing or breaking fragile items.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What\'s the difference between a fish turner and spatula?',
      answer: 'A fish turner and fish spatula are the same tool, different names for the slotted, flexible metal spatula designed for flipping fish. Some people call it a fish turner because of its flipping function, while others call it a fish spatula. Both refer to the thin, slotted tool used for delicate foods.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is a fish slice the same as a fish spatula?',
      answer: 'In British English, "fish slice" refers to the same tool Americans call a fish spatula. Both describe a thin, flexible, slotted metal turner used for lifting and flipping delicate foods like fish fillets, eggs, and pancakes.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Which spatula is best for turning fish?',
      answer: 'The best spatula for turning fish is a slotted metal fish spatula like the Lamson. The thin beveled edge slides under delicate fillets without tearing, the flexibility conforms to curved pan surfaces, and the slots drain oil for crispy skin. After 24 years in professional kitchens, I recommend the Lamson fish spatula for both home and professional use.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use a fish spatula on nonstick pans?',
      answer: 'Metal fish spatulas can scratch nonstick coatings over time. For nonstick pans, consider a silicone fish spatula instead. For cast iron, stainless steel, and carbon steel pans, a metal fish spatula like the Lamson is ideal. The thin edge and flexibility work best with these surfaces.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need a left-handed fish spatula?',
      answer: 'If you\'re left-handed, yes. A left-handed fish spatula makes a noticeable difference. The beveled edge on fish spatulas is angled to slide under food from a specific direction. Left-handed cooks using right-handed spatulas work against the tool\'s design. Lamson is one of the few manufacturers offering a left-handed fish spatula.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is stainless steel or silicone better for fish spatulas?',
      answer: 'Stainless steel fish spatulas are better for most cooking surfaces: cast iron, stainless steel, carbon steel, and grills. The thin metal edge slides under food that silicone can\'t reach. Silicone fish spatulas are only better for nonstick pans, where metal could scratch the coating.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What size fish spatula should I get?',
      answer: 'Standard fish spatulas (around 6-7 inches in blade length) handle most home cooking tasks. This size fits in regular skillets while providing enough surface area to support whole fish fillets. The Lamson fish spatula\'s dimensions work well for both home kitchens and professional use.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can fish spatulas go in the dishwasher?',
      answer: 'While many fish spatulas are technically dishwasher-safe, hand washing extends their lifespan. High-carbon stainless steel (like the Lamson) maintains its edge and finish better with hand washing. A quick wash with soap and water, then thorough drying, keeps your fish spatula in professional condition.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is the Lamson fish spatula worth it?',
      answer: 'After 24 years of professional kitchen experience, yes. The Lamson fish spatula is worth it. The American-made quality, perfect flex, and availability of a left-handed version justify the price. Cheaper fish spatulas often have poor flexibility or construction that fails over time. The Lamson is a buy-it-for-life tool.'

      'The Lamson also stands alone in offering a left-handed version, a detail that matters more than most people realize. If you\'ve been using a regular spatula for delicate foods and wondering why fish sticks or eggs tear, a proper fish spatula like the Lamson will change how you cook. This is the best fish spatula for home cooks who want professional results.'
