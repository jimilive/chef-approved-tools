    sections: [
      {
        title: 'Why I Chose This for My Daily Toolkit',
        content: 'After 24 years in professional kitchens, I\'ve broken down thousands of chickens, deboned countless pork loins, and filleted more fish than I can count. This knife makes those tasks fast and efficient. The granton edge (those oval indentations along the blade) creates air pockets that prevent meat from sticking to the blade. The narrow blade profile allows you to work close to bone contours, giving you maximum yield and minimal waste. A chef\'s knife can break down a chicken, but it\'s not the right tool. This boning knife saves time, reduces waste, and makes butchery work cleaner and more precise.'

      {
        title: 'Granton Edge Technology',
        content: 'The oval indentations along the blade create air pockets that prevent meat from sticking. This matters when you\'re making long cuts through proteins - the blade glides smoothly without resistance. Game-changer for efficiency in professional settings where speed matters.'
      },
      {
        title: 'Narrow Blade Design',
        content: 'The narrow blade profile allows you to work close to bone contours, getting every bit of meat off the bone. Essential for breaking down chickens, deboning pork, and filleting fish. Provides control and precision for detailed butchery work.'
      },
      {
        title: 'Curved Blade Profile',
        content: 'The slight curve to the blade makes it easier to work around joints and bones. Natural rocking motion follows bone contours. Sharp, narrow tip gets into tight spaces between joints for clean separation.'
      },
      {
        title: 'Real Restaurant Experience',
        content: 'From managing kitchen operations at Mellow Mushroom to working the line at fine dining restaurants, I\'ve used this knife to break down 50+ whole chickens per shift, debone pork loins and tenderloins, fillet fish for seafood specials, remove silver skin from beef tenderloins, and separate meat from bones for stocks and sauces. In a professional kitchen, speed matters. This knife cuts my butchery time in half compared to using a chef\'s knife. Clean cuts, minimal waste, and the blade stays sharp through heavy use.'

  // FAQ SCHEMA DATA
  faqData: [
    {
      question: 'What is a Granton edge?',
      answer: 'The Granton edge features dimples (also called \'scallops\' or \'kullens\') along the blade that create air pockets, preventing meat from sticking to the knife during slicing.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What blade style is this knife?',
      answer: 'This is a stiff boning knife, which excels at beef, pork, and poultry. The stiff blade provides more control for working around bones and joints.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What meats is this knife best for?',
      answer: 'Excellent for deboning chicken, trimming silver skin from beef, removing fat, portioning fish, and any task requiring precision cuts around bones and joints.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is the Victorinox boning knife dishwasher safe?',
      answer: 'Yes with the Fibrox handle, but hand washing is recommended to protect the blade edge and prevent it from dulling from contact with other items.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I maintain and sharpen this knife?',
      answer: 'Regular honing with a steel keeps the edge aligned. For sharpening, use a whetstone or professional service when you notice it\'s not cutting cleanly through connective tissue.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How long should a boning knife last?',
      answer: 'With proper care, a Victorinox boning knife can last decades. The blade won\'t chip or break with normal use, and the warranty covers manufacturing defects.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What\'s the difference between boning and fillet knives?',
      answer: 'Boning knives have a stiff blade designed for working around bones in red meat and poultry. Fillet knives have a thinner, more flexible blade specialized for fish.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use this for general cutting tasks?',
      answer: 'While you could, boning knives are specialized tools. The narrow blade and curve are optimized for working around bones - use a chef\'s knife for general cutting.'
