  { question: "Is Diamond Crystal worth it vs Morton's?", answer: "Yes, for serious cooking. Diamond Crystal has a cleaner flavor profile with no anti-caking agents, and its lighter crystal structure makes it easier to control when seasoning by hand. After using both in professional kitchens, I exclusively buy Diamond Crystal for home use. Morton's kosher salt is denser and contains anti-caking agents, which can leave a slight chemical aftertaste. The crystal shape also makes it harder to pinch precisely. If a recipe specifies Diamond Crystal, substituting Morton's without adjusting quantities will over-salt your food. The cost difference is minimal—usually just a few cents per pound—but the cooking experience is noticeably better with Diamond Crystal." },
  { question: "Why do professional chefs use kosher salt?", answer: "Professional chefs prefer kosher salt because the large crystals are easy to pinch and control when seasoning by hand—the way most cooking happens in restaurants. You can feel exactly how much salt you're adding, which is crucial when you're cooking without measuring spoons. The coarse texture also makes it less likely to over-salt. Fine table salt pours too quickly and clumps in humid kitchens. Kosher salt dissolves evenly, has no additives to affect flavor, and provides consistent results across different cooks in the same kitchen." },
  { question: "Can I use Diamond Crystal for baking?", answer: "Yes, but you need to adjust measurements. Because Diamond Crystal is less dense than table salt, you'll need to use more by volume. Generally, use 2× the amount called for if a recipe specifies table salt. For precision baking (bread, pastries, cakes), I recommend weighing your salt rather than measuring by volume. 1 teaspoon of table salt = approximately 6 grams, while 1 teaspoon of Diamond Crystal = approximately 3 grams." },
  { question: "What is the difference between kosher salt and table salt?", answer: "The main differences are crystal size, additives, and how you use them: Crystal size: Kosher salt has large, irregular crystals that are easy to pinch. Table salt is fine and pours from a shaker. Additives: Table salt usually contains iodine (for thyroid health) and anti-caking agents. Kosher salt typically has neither. Density: Table salt is much denser. Flavor: Pure kosher salt tastes cleaner. Table salt can have slight metallic or chemical notes from additives." },
  { question: "How much Diamond Crystal equals table salt?", answer: "Diamond Crystal is about half as dense as table salt by volume. Here are the conversions: 1 teaspoon table salt = 2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal, 1 tablespoon table salt = 2 tablespoons Diamond Crystal. This is why weighing salt is more accurate for baking. Volume measurements vary significantly between salt types, but weight stays consistent." },
  { question: "Is Diamond Crystal the same as Morton kosher salt?", answer: "No, they're significantly different despite both being kosher salt: Crystal shape: Diamond Crystal has flat, hollow pyramids. Morton's has dense, irregular flakes. Density: Morton's is nearly twice as dense as Diamond Crystal by volume. Additives: Diamond Crystal has none. Morton's contains anti-caking agents. Flavor: Diamond Crystal tastes cleaner without the slight chemical note from Morton's additives." },
  { question: "Does Diamond Crystal have iodine?", answer: "No, Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt does not contain iodine. It's pure salt with no additives—no iodine, no anti-caking agents, nothing but sodium chloride. If you need iodine in your diet (important for thyroid function), you have options: Get iodine from other sources like seafood, dairy, or eggs; take an iodine supplement; use iodized table salt for finishing; or keep both types." },
  { question: "Why is it called kosher salt?", answer: "The name comes from its traditional use in koshering meat—the Jewish process of removing blood from meat to make it kosher. The large crystals are perfect for drawing out blood and moisture from meat surfaces. Despite the name, kosher salt itself isn't necessarily kosher-certified (though Diamond Crystal is). The term refers to its function in the koshering process, not its religious certification." },
  { question: "Where can I buy Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt?", answer: "Diamond Crystal is available at most major grocery stores, though availability varies by region. Most reliable sources: Amazon (most consistent availability, often sold in 3-packs), restaurant supply stores (best value for bulk), major grocery chains (salt/spice aisle, usually bottom shelf), and natural food stores (stock it due to no-additive formula)." },
  { question: "How should I store kosher salt?", answer: "Salt doesn't spoil, but proper storage keeps it free-flowing and easy to use: Keep it dry in an airtight container or keep the box closed when not in use. Use a salt cellar by the stove for quick access. Avoid moisture—don't use wet hands to grab salt. Store at room temperature. Diamond Crystal doesn't clump as much as Morton's due to the lack of anti-caking agents, but it'll still absorb moisture in very humid environments." }

        <h2>Professional Verdict</h2>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          <strong>For 6 years at Purple Café, a 200+ cover restaurant, Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt
          was the only salt we used in the kitchen.</strong> Cases of it. Monthly deliveries. Every station had a
          container within reach. Why? Because when you&apos;re seasoning hundreds of plates per
          service, you need salt that&apos;s predictable, fast to pinch, and clean-tasting every time.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Thirteen years after leaving the restaurant, it&apos;s still the only salt in my home
          kitchen. That&apos;s 18 years of combined professional and personal use—from 2007 to today. I&apos;ve never
          found a reason to switch.

          <p className="my-2">
            <strong>✗ Skip If:</strong> You rarely cook from scratch, prefer fine table salt for precision baking recipes,
            need iodized salt for dietary reasons

      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
        At <a href="/about" className="text-blue-600 font-bold">Purple Café</a>, Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt wasn&apos;t just preferred—it was required.
        Every prep station and every line cook used it exclusively from 2007-2012.

      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
        We went through cases every month. Seasoning proteins before searing. Pasta water. Vegetable
        prep. Finishing plates at expo. Brines for poultry. Every dish that left the kitchen was
        seasoned with Diamond Crystal.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
        Why the mandate? In a professional kitchen serving 200+ guests nightly, seasoning must be:

      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
        When I left Purple Café in 2012, Diamond Crystal came home with me. Thirteen years later,
        it&apos;s still the only salt I buy. Same recognizable box on my counter. Same predictable crystals.
        Same clean flavor.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
        I&apos;ve tested expensive finishing salts like Maldon and fleur de sel. Tried Morton for comparison.
        Experimented with various sea salts. Always come back to Diamond Crystal. Eighteen years of daily use—professional and
        personal—and I&apos;ve never found anything better for everyday cooking.

      {/* Technical Details */}
      <h2>What Makes Diamond Crystal Different</h2>

      <h3>The Crystal Structure</h3>

      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
        Diamond Crystal is made using the Alberger process, which creates hollow, pyramid-shaped crystals.
        This unique structure makes the salt lighter and fluffier than other kosher salts—about half the
        density of Morton&apos;s. That means:
      </p>

      <ul className="text-base leading-relaxed">
        <li>Easier to control when pinching</li>
        <li>Dissolves faster on food</li>
        <li>More forgiving if you slightly over-season</li>
        <li>Different volume-to-weight ratio than Morton&apos;s (important for recipes)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>No Additives</h3>

      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
        Unlike many salts, Diamond Crystal contains no anti-caking agents. Just salt. This keeps the
        flavor clean and pure. The crystals don&apos;t clump in humid environments as much as you&apos;d
        expect—I&apos;ve used it in both dry Montana kitchens and humid Seattle restaurants without issues.
      </p>

      <h3>Conversion Note</h3>

      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
        If a recipe calls for Diamond Crystal and you substitute Morton&apos;s kosher salt, use about half
        as much. Diamond Crystal is less dense, so 1 tablespoon of Diamond Crystal ≈ 1½ teaspoons of Morton&apos;s.

          <h3>Why do professional chefs use kosher salt?</h3>
          <div>
            <div>
              <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Professional chefs prefer kosher salt because the large crystals are easy to pinch and control when seasoning by hand—the way most cooking happens in restaurants.

              <p>In my 6 years at Purple Café, we never used anything but Diamond Crystal for actual cooking. It&apos;s the industry standard for good reason.

        <div className="my-5 p-5 bg-gray-50 rounded-md">
          <h3>Can I use Diamond Crystal for baking?</h3>
          <div>
            <div>
              <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, but you need to adjust measurements. Because Diamond Crystal is less dense than table salt, you&apos;ll need to use more by volume. Generally, use 2× the amount called for if a recipe specifies table salt.</p>
              <p>For precision baking (bread, pastries, cakes), I recommend weighing your salt rather than measuring by volume. 1 teaspoon of table salt = approximately 6 grams, while 1 teaspoon of Diamond Crystal = approximately 3 grams.</p>
              <p>Many modern baking recipes now specify Diamond Crystal kosher salt because it&apos;s become the test kitchen standard. If the recipe explicitly calls for it, use it as directed.</p>

          <h3>What is the difference between kosher salt and table salt?</h3>
          <div>
            <div>
              <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The main differences are crystal size, additives, and how you use them:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Crystal size:</strong> Kosher salt has large, irregular crystals that are easy to pinch. Table salt is fine and pours from a shaker.</li>
                <li><strong>Additives:</strong> Table salt usually contains iodine (for thyroid health) and anti-caking agents. Kosher salt typically has neither.</li>
                <li><strong>Density:</strong> Table salt is much denser. 1 tablespoon of Diamond Crystal ≈ 1¾ teaspoons of table salt.</li>
                <li><strong>Flavor:</strong> Pure kosher salt tastes cleaner. Table salt can have slight metallic or chemical notes from additives.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>In professional kitchens, we season by pinching salt from a container, making kosher salt&apos;s large crystals essential. At home, I keep both—Diamond Crystal for cooking, fine sea salt for the table.</p>

        </div>

        {/* Question 5 */}
        <div className="my-5 p-5 bg-gray-50 rounded-md">
          <h3>How much Diamond Crystal equals table salt?</h3>
          <div>
            <div>
              <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Diamond Crystal is about half as dense as table salt by volume. Here are the conversions:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>1 teaspoon table salt = 2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon table salt = 2 tablespoons Diamond Crystal</li>
                <li>By weight: 1 teaspoon table salt (6g) = 2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal (6g)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This is why weighing salt is more accurate for baking. Volume measurements vary significantly between salt types, but weight stays consistent.</p>
              <p>If converting a recipe from table salt to Diamond Crystal, double the volume. If going from Diamond Crystal to table salt, cut the volume in half. When in doubt, undersalt and adjust to taste.</p>

        {/* Question 6 */}
        <div className="my-5 p-5 bg-gray-50 rounded-md">
          <h3>Is Diamond Crystal the same as Morton kosher salt?</h3>
          <div>
            <div>
              <p><strong>Answer:</strong> No, they&apos;re significantly different despite both being kosher salt:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Crystal shape:</strong> Diamond Crystal has flat, hollow pyramids. Morton&apos;s has dense, irregular flakes.</li>
                <li><strong>Density:</strong> Morton&apos;s is nearly twice as dense as Diamond Crystal by volume.</li>
                <li><strong>Additives:</strong> Diamond Crystal has none. Morton&apos;s contains anti-caking agents.</li>
                <li><strong>Flavor:</strong> Diamond Crystal tastes cleaner without the slight chemical note from Morton&apos;s additives.</li>
                <li><strong>Dissolution:</strong> Diamond Crystal dissolves faster due to hollow crystals.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>In recipes, 1 tablespoon of Diamond Crystal ≈ 1½ teaspoons of Morton&apos;s. They&apos;re not interchangeable without adjusting quantities. Most test kitchens and cookbooks that specify kosher salt mean Diamond Crystal.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        {/* Question 7 */}
        <div className="my-5 p-5 bg-gray-50 rounded-md">
          <h3>Does Diamond Crystal have iodine?</h3>
          <div>
            <div>
              <p><strong>Answer:</strong> No, Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt does not contain iodine. It&apos;s pure salt with no additives—no iodine, no anti-caking agents, nothing but sodium chloride.</p>
              <p>If you need iodine in your diet (important for thyroid function), you have a few options:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Get iodine from other sources like seafood, dairy, or eggs</li>
                <li>Take an iodine supplement</li>
                <li>Use iodized table salt for finishing or at the table</li>
                <li>Keep both: Diamond Crystal for cooking, iodized salt for the table</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Most people who eat a varied diet get adequate iodine without iodized salt. But if you cook everything from scratch and don&apos;t eat much seafood or dairy, consider your iodine intake.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        {/* Question 8 */}
        <div className="my-5 p-5 bg-gray-50 rounded-md">
          <h3>Why is it called kosher salt?</h3>
          <div>
            <div>
              <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The name comes from its traditional use in koshering meat—the Jewish process of removing blood from meat to make it kosher. The large crystals are perfect for drawing out blood and moisture from meat surfaces.</p>
              <p>Despite the name, kosher salt itself isn&apos;t necessarily kosher-certified (though Diamond Crystal is). The term refers to its function in the koshering process, not its religious certification.</p>
              <p>The name stuck because these coarse salts became popular in professional kitchens for their ease of use, then spread to home cooking. Now when chefs say &quot;kosher salt,&quot; we&apos;re referring to the crystal size and texture, not the religious dietary laws.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        {/* Question 9 */}
        <div className="my-5 p-5 bg-gray-50 rounded-md">
          <h3>Where can I buy Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt?</h3>
          <div>
            <div>
              <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Diamond Crystal is available at most major grocery stores, though availability varies by region. I&apos;ve found it most reliably at:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Amazon:</strong> Most consistent availability, often sold in 3-packs</li>
                <li><strong>Restaurant supply stores:</strong> Usually the best value for bulk</li>
                <li><strong>Major grocery chains:</strong> Look in the salt/spice aisle, usually on the bottom shelf</li>
                <li><strong>Natural food stores:</strong> Often stock it due to the no-additive formula</li>
              </ul>
              <p>If your local store doesn&apos;t carry it, ask them to order it. Many stores will special-order products if customers request them. The 3-pound boxes last several months in home kitchens, and buying in bulk is more economical.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        {/* Question 10 */}
        <div className="my-5 p-5 bg-gray-50 rounded-md">
          <h3>How should I store kosher salt?</h3>
          <div>
            <div>
              <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Salt doesn&apos;t spoil, but proper storage keeps it free-flowing and easy to use:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Keep it dry:</strong> Store in an airtight container or keep the box closed when not in use</li>
                <li><strong>Use a salt cellar:</strong> I keep a small open container by the stove for quick access while cooking</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid moisture:</strong> Don&apos;t use wet hands to grab salt, and keep away from steam</li>
                <li><strong>Room temperature:</strong> No need to refrigerate—just keep it in a cabinet or on the counter</li>
              </ul>
              <p>In my home kitchen, I transfer some into a small ceramic salt pig that sits next to the stove. The rest stays in the original box in a cabinet. I refill the salt pig every few weeks. This system has worked perfectly for 18 years.</p>
              <p>Diamond Crystal doesn&apos;t clump as much as Morton&apos;s due to the lack of anti-caking agents, but it&apos;ll still absorb moisture in very humid environments. If it does clump, break it up with a spoon—it&apos;s still perfectly usable.</p>

          Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt has earned its place as the only salt I buy. For 6 years at Purple Café,
          it seasoned thousands of plates without a single complaint. Thirteen years later, it&apos;s still
          the standard in my home kitchen.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          The hollow pyramid crystals make it easy to control. The lack of additives keeps the flavor clean.
          The consistent size means predictable results whether I&apos;m cooking or someone else is following
          my recipes. It&apos;s simply the best all-purpose salt for serious cooking.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Is it perfect for everything? No. I keep finishing salts for special occasions and fine sea salt
          for the table. But for 99% of cooking—from seasoning proteins to pasta water to vegetable prep—Diamond
          Crystal is unmatched.
