        content: "The 10-inch blade gives you the reach needed for whole chickens, large cabbages, and pork shoulders. Longer blade means better slicing motion and fewer strokes through large items. When you're breaking down a whole chicken or portioning a roast, those extra 2 inches make a noticeable difference in efficiency and control."

        title: "Ideal for Larger Hands",
        content: "If you're over 6 feet tall or have larger hands, the 10-inch feels more natural than the 8-inch. The longer blade provides better reach without requiring you to grip closer to the blade. In professional kitchens, I've noticed taller cooks gravitate toward the 10-inch for comfort during extended prep sessions."

        title: "Professional Kitchen Performance",
        content: "After 45 years of cooking and countless knives tested, the Victorinox 10-inch chef's knife is my choice for high-volume protein breakdown. From managing kitchen operations at Mellow Mushroom to working the line at fine dining restaurants, I've used this knife to break down 50+ whole chickens per week, portion large pork shoulders and beef roasts, slice through whole butternut squash and large cabbages, and prep oversized vegetables for bulk meal prep. The knife has never let me down. No chipping, no handle issues, no rust. Just consistent performance day after day."

        title: "When to Choose 10-Inch Over 8-Inch",
        content: "Choose the 10-inch if you have larger hands (generally 6 feet or taller), regularly break down whole proteins, do extensive meal prep with large vegetables, have ample counter and cutting board space, or prefer longer blades for slicing motion. Stick with the 8-inch if you have smaller hands, work in compact kitchens, need more precise/delicate cutting, or want a more versatile all-purpose knife."

Same high-carbon stainless steel, same NSF-certified fibrox handle, same Swiss manufacturing quality, same exceptional edge retention, and same unbeatable value proposition. The only difference is blade length and who it's best suited for."

    items: [
      {
        question: "Is the Victorinox Fibrox Pro 10\" chef's knife worth the money?",
        answer: "Absolutely. Based on 20 years using this knife (including 10 professionally), it delivers the same performance as chef knives costing hundreds more. The high-carbon stainless steel holds an edge exceptionally well, the Fibrox handle provides superior grip, and it's proven reliable in professional kitchens worldwide. The exceptional value makes it one of the best investments for serious home cooks and professionals alike."
      },
      {
        question: "Should I get the 10\" or 8\" Victorinox chef's knife?",
        answer: "Choose the 10\" if you have larger hands (generally if you're over 6 feet tall), regularly break down whole proteins, or do extensive meal prep with large vegetables. The 8\" is better for smaller hands, compact kitchens, or more precise cutting work. I keep both in my home kitchen - the 8\" for daily tasks and the 10\" for bigger jobs like breaking down chickens or portioning large roasts."
      },
      {
        question: "How do I sharpen the Victorinox Fibrox Pro knife?",
        answer: "Hone the knife before each use with a honing steel (10 seconds). For actual sharpening, either take it to a professional sharpener monthly or learn to use a whetstone. I recommend a 1000/6000 grit whetstone for home use. The high-carbon stainless steel sharpens easily and holds an edge well between sharpenings. Avoid pull-through sharpeners as they can damage the blade geometry."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I put the Victorinox Fibrox knife in the dishwasher?",
        answer: "The Fibrox handle is technically dishwasher-safe, but I strongly recommend hand-washing the entire knife. Dishwashers can dull the blade, cause it to knock against other items, and reduce its lifespan. Hand-wash immediately after use, dry completely, and store properly. This takes 30 seconds and will keep your knife performing like new for decades."
      },
      {
        question: "What cutting board should I use with this knife?",
        answer: "Use wood or high-quality plastic cutting boards. Never use glass, ceramic, or marble cutting boards as they will dull the blade quickly. I use end-grain wooden cutting boards in my professional kitchen as they're gentle on knife edges while being durable and naturally antimicrobial. A good cutting board is just as important as a good knife for maintaining edge sharpness."
      },
      {
        question: "How long does the Victorinox Fibrox Pro knife last?",
        answer: "With proper care, this knife will last decades. I've been using Victorinox knives for 20 years, and they show minimal wear. The key is regular honing, proper sharpening when needed, hand-washing, and storing properly. The Fibrox handle is incredibly durable and resistant to cracking or degrading. This is genuinely a buy-it-for-life tool if you maintain it correctly."
      },
      {
        question: "Is the 10\" knife too big for home cooking?",
        answer: "Not if you have larger hands or regularly work with whole proteins and large vegetables. The 10\" excels at breaking down whole chickens, portioning roasts, and slicing through large butternut squash. However, if you have smaller hands or a compact kitchen, the 8\" version will be more comfortable. Consider your hand size and the types of cutting tasks you do most often."
      },
      {
        question: "Does this knife come sharp from the factory?",
        answer: "Yes, Victorinox knives arrive very sharp from the factory. You can start using it immediately for professional-level cutting. However, I recommend giving it a few passes on a honing steel before first use to align the edge, and then hone it regularly before each use to maintain peak sharpness. This simple habit keeps the knife performing at its best."
      },
      {
        question: "What warranty does Victorinox offer?",
        answer: "Victorinox offers a lifetime warranty against defects in material and workmanship. This covers manufacturing defects but not normal wear, misuse, or abuse. In my 20 years using Victorinox knives, I've never needed to use the warranty - these knives are incredibly reliable. The warranty is reassuring, but the real value is in the proven durability and performance."
      },
      {
        question: "How does this compare to expensive Japanese chef knives?",
        answer: "Japanese knives typically use harder steel that holds an edge longer but is more delicate and requires expert sharpening. The Victorinox uses softer German-style steel that's more forgiving, easier to sharpen, and more durable for heavy-duty work. For professional restaurant use and serious home cooking, the Victorinox is often the better choice due to its reliability and ease of maintenance. I use both types in my kitchen, but the Victorinox is my workhorse for daily tasks."

The Mercer is a solid budget alternative, but the Victorinox's superior edge retention and NSF certification make it worth the small price difference."
