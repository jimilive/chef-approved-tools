    content: "Most underrated tool in any kitchen. After 20 years of use—including 6 years of daily professional use at Purple Café—this bench scraper has proven indispensable for transferring ingredients, portioning dough, and cleaning surfaces. Once you start using one, you&apos;ll wonder how you cooked without it. At $15, it&apos;s essential."

  whyIChoseThis: {
    title: "Why This Is in My Daily Toolkit",
    paragraphs: [
      "After 45 years of cooking and 24 years in professional kitchens, I can tell you the bench scraper is the tool most home cooks don&apos;t know they need. At Purple Café in Seattle, I used this tool every single day for 6 years—transferring chopped vegetables, portioning pizza dough, cleaning cutting boards, and scraping work surfaces.",
      "The bench scraper transforms your workflow. In professional kitchens, it&apos;s used constantly because it eliminates wasted motion. Chop an onion, scrape it directly into the pan—no picking up pieces with your knife or hands. Portion pizza dough, cut it cleanly with the bench scraper—no sticky knife. Clean your cutting board between tasks—bench scraper removes every scrap in seconds.",
      "The OXO version has the perfect combination of features: sharp but safe edge for cutting dough, comfortable grip for extended use, measurement markings for consistent portioning, and a wide flat blade for transferring ingredients. After testing this exact model for 20 years, it&apos;s the one I recommend."

  // SECTION 4: PURPLE CAFÉ PROFESSIONAL TESTING (NEW - EXPANDED)
  professionalTesting: {
    title: "6 Years of Daily Professional Use at Purple Café",
    intro: "From 2007-2012 at Purple Café in Seattle, this bench scraper was part of my daily toolkit. Here&apos;s exactly how it performed under professional restaurant conditions:",
    sections: [
      {
        task: "Transferring Chopped Vegetables",
        description: "Every prep shift started with chopping vegetables for pizza toppings—onions, peppers, mushrooms, tomatoes. The bench scraper moved everything from cutting board to pan in one smooth motion. Faster than picking up pieces with your knife, cleaner than using your hands. After 6 years of daily use, this saved countless hours of wasted motion."
      },
      {
        task: "Portioning Pizza Dough",
        description: "We portioned dozens of pizza dough balls daily. The bench scraper&apos;s straight edge cut through dough cleanly without dragging or sticking. The measurement markings helped create consistent portions—critical when you&apos;re making 30+ pizzas per shift. A sharp knife pulls and tears dough; the bench scraper cuts it clean."
      },
      {
        task: "Cleaning Cutting Boards Between Tasks",
        description: "In a professional kitchen, you can&apos;t wash your cutting board after every ingredient. The bench scraper removes vegetable scraps, dough bits, and debris in seconds. Scrape everything into the trash, wipe the board, move to the next task. This tool kept our prep stations clean and efficient throughout service."
      },
      {
        task: "Scraping Work Surfaces During Prep",
        description: "Dough and flour accumulate on stainless steel work surfaces. The bench scraper cleared surfaces quickly without scratching the steel. The beveled edge glides across surfaces when held at a slight angle—efficient cleaning without damage."
      },
      {
        task: "Cleaning Wood Pizza Peels (The Tricky One)",
        description: "This is where technique matters. Wood pizza peels (especially soft pine) require gentle cleaning to avoid damage. The bench scraper works perfectly if you use light pressure and the correct angle. Hold it nearly flat against the peel surface, not straight down. This removes stuck dough and flour without gouging the wood. I cleaned our pizza peels this way for 6 years—same peels, no damage. But if you press too hard or use the wrong angle, you&apos;ll leave marks in soft wood. Gentle pressure, shallow angle, let the blade do the work."
      }
    ],
    durability: "After 6 years of daily professional use at Purple Café—hundreds of dishwasher cycles, constant contact with dough and vegetables, repeated scraping of cutting boards and work surfaces—this OXO bench scraper showed minimal wear. The stainless steel blade remained straight and functional. The Good Grips handle stayed comfortable without degradation. No rust, no loosening, no failures. The same scraper that started my Purple Café tenure was still working when I left.",
    conclusion: "In professional kitchens, tools either survive or get replaced. This bench scraper survived 6 years of daily restaurant use and is still in my home kitchen today, 13+ years later. That&apos;s the definition of professional-grade durability."

    title: "What Makes This Tool Work",
    features: [
      {
        title: "Stainless Steel Blade",
        description: "The sharp, straight edge cleanly cuts through dough without dragging. Wide blade surface (5.5 inches) easily scoops and transfers chopped ingredients. Beveled edge prevents cutting into cutting boards while effectively scraping them clean. After 20 years, the stainless steel shows no rust, no staining, no degradation."
      },
      {
        title: "Good Grips Handle",
        description: "The soft, non-slip handle stays comfortable during extended use—critical for professional prep sessions. Ergonomic design provides control when cutting dough or scraping surfaces. Doesn&apos;t slip when wet, covered in flour, or when your hands are greasy. After 6 years at Purple Café using this handle daily, the comfort difference versus all-metal scrapers is significant."
      },
      {
        title: "Measurement Markings",
        description: "Built-in measurements (both inches and centimeters) help portion dough evenly. Perfect for dividing pizza dough into consistent balls—essential when you&apos;re making 30+ pizzas per shift. The markings are etched into the blade, not printed, so they won&apos;t wear off after years of dishwasher cycles."
      },
      {
        title: "Beveled Edge Design",
        description: "The beveled edge is the secret to effective scraping without damage. When held at a slight angle (not straight down), it glides across cutting boards, work surfaces, and even delicate wood pizza peels without gouging. This design detail separates professional-grade scrapers from cheap alternatives that can scratch surfaces."

    title: "Frequently Asked Questions",
    items: [
      {
        question: "Do I really need a bench scraper?",
        answer: "If you do any regular cooking or baking, yes. After 24 years in professional kitchens and 20 years using this exact bench scraper, I can tell you it transforms your workflow. At Purple Café, I used this tool every single day for 6 years—transferring vegetables, portioning dough, cleaning surfaces. Once you start using one, you&apos;ll wonder how you cooked without it. It&apos;s one of those tools where you don&apos;t realize how much you need it until you have it."
      },
      {
        question: "Is the OXO better than a generic bench scraper?",
        answer: "Yes, significantly better for daily use. The Good Grips handle makes a real difference during extended prep sessions—after 6 years of professional use, I can confirm the comfort advantage matters. The measurement markings are genuinely useful for consistent dough portioning. Generic scrapers work but become uncomfortable after 15-20 minutes of continuous use. The OXO&apos;s extra $7-9 is worth it if you use it regularly."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I use this to cut dough?",
        answer: "Absolutely—it&apos;s one of the primary uses. The stainless steel blade cuts cleanly through all types of dough: bread, pizza, cookie, pastry. At Purple Café, we portioned dozens of pizza dough balls daily with this scraper. The straight edge gives clean cuts without dragging or tearing. The measurement markings help create consistent portions. It&apos;s far superior to using a knife, which pulls and tears dough."
      },
      {
        question: "Will this scratch my cutting board?",
        answer: "No, when used properly. The beveled edge is designed to scrape surfaces clean without digging in. Hold it at a slight angle (not straight down) and it glides across wood, plastic, or stone boards without damage. I&apos;ve used mine on my John Boos maple cutting board for years with zero scratches. The key is technique—shallow angle, gentle pressure, let the beveled edge do the work."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I clean wood pizza peels with this?",
        answer: "Yes, but technique matters. Wood pizza peels—especially soft pine—require gentle cleaning. Hold the bench scraper nearly flat against the peel surface (shallow angle, not straight down) and use light pressure. This removes stuck dough and flour without gouging the wood. At Purple Café, I cleaned our soft pine pizza peels this way for 6 years with no damage. But if you press too hard or use the wrong angle, you&apos;ll leave marks. Gentle pressure, shallow angle, let the blade glide."
      },
      {
        question: "Is it dishwasher-safe?",
        answer: "Yes, completely dishwasher-safe. I&apos;ve run this exact scraper through hundreds of dishwasher cycles over 20 years—including 6 years of daily professional use at Purple Café—with zero degradation to the blade or handle. No rust, no loosening, no handle deterioration. The etched measurements don&apos;t fade. That said, it&apos;s easy to hand wash if you prefer."
      },
      {
        question: "How long will this last?",
        answer: "Decades with proper care. I&apos;ve been using this exact OXO bench scraper for 20 years—including 6 years of daily professional restaurant use. Same scraper, still fully functional, no replacements needed. The stainless steel doesn&apos;t rust or degrade. The Good Grips handle stays comfortable. There&apos;s no wear mechanism that would cause failure. Expect 15-20+ years minimum for home use."
      },
      {
        question: "What else can I use this for besides transferring ingredients?",
        answer: "Many tasks: cutting and portioning all types of dough, scraping cutting boards clean between tasks, removing stuck-on food from surfaces, cleaning work surfaces during prep, spreading frosting or filling, dividing cookie dough into portions, cleaning wood pizza peels (gently), scraping countertops, and even as an emergency spatula. At Purple Café, I used it for all of these tasks daily. It&apos;s incredibly versatile."
