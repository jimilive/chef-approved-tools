    verdict: 'After 20 years using large hotel pans professionally and at home, full and 1/3 pans are essential for anyone doing serious batch cooking, party prep, or large-family meal planning. These aren\'t everyday containers—they\'re for when you need serious volume. Marinating 30 chicken thighs for a BBQ. Batch-cooking 20 pounds of pulled pork. Prepping salad ingredients for a family reunion. The standardized sizing means everything stacks perfectly, lids are interchangeable, and you can organize massive amounts of food efficiently. Every restaurant uses these for prep and cold storage because nothing else handles volume this efficiently.',

      {
        title: 'Batch Cooking Performance',
        content: 'Full hotel pans hold massive quantities: 20+ lbs of pulled pork, 5 gallons of soup, 30 marinating chicken pieces. The depth (6 inches) means you can stack food without crushing, store liquids without spilling, and organize ingredients efficiently. After 20 years, I use full pans for every large gathering—they make batch cooking manageable instead of chaotic.'
      },
      {
        title: '1/3 Pans: The Home Kitchen Sweet Spot',
        content: '1/3 pans are incredibly versatile for home use. Big enough for serious portions (8-12 servings), small enough to fit in standard refrigerators without dominating space. I use them for marinating proteins, storing prepped vegetables, organizing party ingredients, and batch-cooking sides for the week. They stack perfectly with full pans using the same lid system.'
      },
      {
        title: 'Restaurant Durability',
        content: 'NSF-certified polypropylene survives decades of daily use in commercial kitchens. At home, these pans are virtually indestructible. Dishwasher safe through thousands of cycles, freezer safe, and resistant to staining from acidic foods. The same pans I bought 20 years ago still work perfectly—no cracks, warping, or degradation.'
      },
      {
        title: 'Space Efficiency',
        content: 'The standardized sizing means large pans nest perfectly with each other and with smaller hotel pans. Stack full pans together, stack 1/3 pans together, mix and match—everything fits efficiently. This matters when you\'re storing 10+ pans in a pantry or organizing ingredients for a big event.'

    title: 'Why Large Pans Are Essential for Batch Cooking',
    sections: [
      {
        title: 'The Volume Advantage',
        content: 'Large hotel pans solve the "not enough container space" problem. When you\'re marinating 30 chicken thighs, storing 15 pounds of prepped salad ingredients, or batch-cooking pulled pork for 50 people, you need serious volume. Full hotel pans hold 20+ pounds of food easily. 1/3 pans hold 8-12 servings—perfect for weekly meal prep or party sides. The depth (6 inches) means food doesn\'t get crushed when stacked, and liquids don\'t spill during transport.'
      },
      {
        title: 'Professional Batch Cooking Workflow',
        content: 'This is how restaurants prep for service, and it works perfectly at home: Use full pans for marinating large quantities of protein (whole chickens, 20+ lbs of ribs, bulk seafood). Use 1/3 pans for prepped vegetables, cooked grains, salad ingredients, and party components. Everything stacks perfectly in walk-in coolers—or in your refrigerator if space allows. The standardized sizing means you can organize ingredients efficiently, see what you have at a glance, and access everything without container avalanches.'
      },
      {
        title: 'When to Use Large vs Small Pans',
        content: 'Small hotel pans (1/6, 1/9) are for everyday meal prep and daily leftovers. Large pans (full, 1/3) are for batch cooking, party prep, and large-family meal planning. Use large pans when cooking for 10+ people, marinating bulk proteins, storing party ingredients, or doing serious weekly meal prep. Use small pans for daily portion storage and regular weeknight cooking. Most serious home cooks need both systems.'
      },
      {
        title: 'The 1/3 Pan: Home Kitchen Versatility',
        content: 'After 20 years of home testing, 6-inch 1/3 pans are the most useful large size for home kitchens. They fit in standard refrigerators (full pans often don\'t), hold enough for serious batch cooking (8-12 servings), and stack efficiently with other hotel pans. I use 1/3 pans more than full pans at home because they balance capacity with practical refrigerator space. Start here unless you regularly cook for 20+ people.'

  // FAQ SCHEMA DATA
  faqData: [
    {
      question: 'Will full hotel pans fit in my refrigerator?',
      answer: 'Full pans (21" × 12.75") may not fit in standard home refrigerators, especially side-by-side models. Measure your fridge shelves before buying. If space is tight, 1/3 pans (12.75" × 7") fit standard refrigerators easily and still provide serious capacity for batch cooking. Most home cooks find 1/3 pans more practical than full pans.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How much food do these pans hold?',
      answer: 'Full pans (6" deep) hold 20+ lbs of solid food or about 5 gallons of liquid. 1/3 pans (6" deep) hold 8-12 servings of most foods—enough for a week of meal prep or party sides for 10-15 people. The depth means you can stack ingredients without crushing.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Are they dishwasher safe?',
      answer: 'Yes—fully dishwasher safe, even in commercial dishwashers at high temperatures. I\'ve been washing large hotel pans in dishwashers for 20 years with no warping, cracking, or degradation. The NSF-certified polypropylene is designed for this.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I freeze food in these pans?',
      answer: 'Yes—they\'re freezer safe. I use them for freezing stock, soup, batch-cooked proteins, and meal prep portions. The plastic won\'t crack or become brittle in freezer temperatures. Just leave headroom for liquid expansion when freezing soups or stocks.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need full pans or 1/3 pans?',
      answer: 'Start with 1/3 pans unless you regularly cook for 20+ people. They fit standard refrigerators, hold enough for serious batch cooking (8-12 servings), and stack efficiently. Only buy full pans if you have refrigerator space and frequently cook in bulk for large gatherings. Most home cooks find 1/3 pans more practical.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How do large pans compare to small hotel pans?',
      answer: 'Small pans (1/6, 1/9) are for everyday meal prep and daily leftovers. Large pans (full, 1/3) are for batch cooking and party prep. Most serious home cooks need both—small pans for regular use, large pans for when you\'re cooking at scale. They all use the same standardized sizing system.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Where should I store large hotel pans?',
      answer: 'Stack them in a pantry or cabinet when not in use. They nest perfectly—all full pans stack together, all 1/3 pans stack together, and lids stack separately. This takes less space than you\'d think. I keep 6-8 large pans stored in about 2 cubic feet of pantry space.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Are the lids sold separately?',
      answer: 'Yes—lids are sold separately for most sizes. This lets you buy exactly how many you need. Some 1/3 pan sets come with lids included. Check the product description. Having extra lids is useful since you often have multiple pans in use simultaneously.'
