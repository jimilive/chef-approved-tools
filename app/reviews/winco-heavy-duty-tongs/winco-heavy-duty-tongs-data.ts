        content: 'After 45 years of cooking, I know tongs. I\'ve used the flimsy ones that lose tension after a month, the silicone ones that melt on the grill, the expensive ones that aren\'t any better than the cheap ones. Winco makes restaurant equipment. These are the same tongs used in commercial kitchens everywhere - not because they\'re fancy, but because they work. Heavy-duty stainless steel construction. Proper spring tension that doesn\'t wear out. Scalloped edges that grip without slipping.'

In a professional kitchen, tongs are an extension of your hand. These Winco tongs have the right weight, the right grip, and the right tension. They\'re the ones every line cook reaches for first.'

  // FAQ SCHEMA DATA
  faqData: [
    {
      question: 'Are Winco tongs dishwasher safe?',
      answer: 'Yes, all stainless steel Winco tongs are dishwasher safe. They hold up well in commercial dishwashers.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Do Winco tongs have a locking mechanism?',
      answer: 'Most standard Winco utility tongs (like the UT-12) do NOT have a lock. Some newer models do, but the classic versions store unlocked. Store them in a drawer or hang them.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I get the 9-inch or 12-inch tongs?',
      answer: 'I use both daily. The 12-inch are perfect for grilling and keeping your hands away from heat - this is the standard professional length. The 9-inch are more maneuverable for sautéing and stovetop cooking. Both sizes available above with the same extra heavyweight construction and spring tension. If you only buy one pair, get the 12-inch for versatility.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How\'s the spring tension on Winco tongs?',
      answer: 'The coiled spring provides strong, consistent tension that doesn\'t weaken over time. This is a key feature that makes them professional-grade.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How heat-resistant are stainless steel tongs?',
      answer: 'Stainless steel handles heat well but will get hot with prolonged contact with hot cookware. The scalloped tips can withstand direct grill contact.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Are these tongs heavy or lightweight?',
      answer: 'Winco tongs are heavier than typical home-use tongs. The thick stainless steel (0.9mm-1.2mm) makes them sturdy enough for commercial kitchens.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use Winco tongs on nonstick cookware?',
      answer: 'Yes, but be gentle. The scalloped stainless steel edges can scratch nonstick surfaces if you\'re rough. For nonstick, consider silicone-tipped tongs.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How do Winco tongs compare to OXO tongs?',
      answer: 'Winco tongs are more industrial - heavier, no frills, and dirt cheap ($2-5). OXO tongs have cushioned handles, locks, and cost more ($10-15). Both are excellent but serve different needs.'
    }
