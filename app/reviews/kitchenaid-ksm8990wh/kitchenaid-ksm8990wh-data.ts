    title: "Frequently Asked Questions",
    items: [
      {
        question: "Can this replace a Hobart in a commercial bakery?",
        answer: "For bakeries producing under 100 loaves daily with mixing under 4 hours, yes. This KitchenAid Commercial mixer delivers 85-90% of the Hobart's performance at a fraction of the cost. However, if you're running 8+ hour days with continuous mixing, invest in the Hobart N50—it's built for that volume."
      },
      {
        question: "Will this work on a standard kitchen outlet?",
        answer: "Usually yes, but verify your circuit isn't shared with high-draw appliances. The mixer draws 500W, which is fine on a standard 15-amp circuit (1800W capacity). However, if you're also running a coffee maker (1000W), you'll exceed capacity and trip the breaker. Electrician installation of a dedicated 20-amp circuit typically runs $150-300 if needed."
      },
      {
        question: "How does NSF certification matter?",
        answer: "Required by many health departments for commercial food prep. Certifies materials meet sanitation standards."
      },
      {
        question: "What's the difference from the KSM7 residential model?",
        answer: "1.3 HP motor (vs 0.8 HP), 2-year warranty, NSF certification, stainless dishwasher-safe attachments, heavier construction."
      },
      {
        question: "How long will this last in a commercial environment?",
        answer: "Based on my testing and industry experience, expect 8-10 years of 2-4 hours daily use before major service needs."
      },
      {
        question: "What's the noise level compared to residential models?",
        answer: "Slightly louder due to the powerful motor, but quieter than commercial Hobart mixers. Expect 70-75 dB at medium speeds—comparable to a dishwasher."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I use my existing KitchenAid attachments?",
        answer: "Yes, all standard KitchenAid hub attachments fit. However, the commercial unit includes upgraded stainless steel mixing attachments that are dishwasher-safe."
      },
      {
        question: "What's the exact weight and dimensions?",
        answer: "35 lbs (16 kg). Dimensions: 14.6\" W × 11.3\" D × 16.5\" H. With bowl-lift raised, total height reaches ~18\". Measure your counter space carefully."
      },
      {
        question: "Is professional installation required?",
        answer: "No special installation needed. Simply place on a stable surface near a 120V outlet. Consider a dedicated 20-amp circuit if sharing with high-draw appliances."
