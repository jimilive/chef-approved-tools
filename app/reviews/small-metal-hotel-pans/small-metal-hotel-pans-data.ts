    verdict: 'After 20 years using metal hotel pans in professional kitchens and at home, small stainless steel pans are ideal for anyone who hosts gatherings, does outdoor cooking, or roasts in the oven. These aren\'t storage containers. They\'re workhorses for hot holding, BBQ prep, oven roasting, and serving. Oven-safe to 500°F+, they handle high heat that would destroy plastic. Stack them on the grill, fill them with hot food for buffets, roast vegetables for family dinners. The standardized sizing means lids are interchangeable and everything nests perfectly for storage. Every restaurant uses these for hot food service. Now you can too.',

        title: 'High-Heat Performance',
        content: 'Stainless steel handles oven temperatures up to 500°F+ without warping or damage. I use these for roasting vegetables, baking proteins, keeping sides warm on the grill, and hot holding for buffets. The metal conducts heat efficiently and cleans easily after high-heat cooking.'

        title: 'Hot Holding Excellence',
        content: 'This is what metal pans excel at: keeping hot food hot during service. Whether it\'s a backyard BBQ, holiday dinner, or family gathering, metal pans hold temperature better than ceramic or plastic. Stack them on a grill corner, use them as warming trays, or transfer them directly from oven to table.'
      },
      {
        title: 'BBQ and Outdoor Cooking',
        content: 'Metal pans make outdoor cooking much easier. Use them as prep trays on the grill, for catching drippings, warming buns, holding cooked meat while it rests, or serving sides. The stainless steel won\'t melt, crack, or warp from grill heat. After 20 years of BBQs, I can\'t imagine outdoor cooking without these.'

At home, they\'re virtually indestructible. No coating to wear off, no rust, no degradation, just stainless steel that performs the same after 20 years.'

    title: 'Why Metal Pans Work for Hot Food',
    sections: [
      {
        title: 'The Hot Holding Advantage',
        content: 'Metal hotel pans excel at one thing plastic can\'t do: handling hot food. Restaurants use stainless steel for hot holding on steam tables, warming trays, and buffet service because metal conducts heat efficiently and maintains food temperature. At home, this means keeping mashed potatoes hot during dinner service, holding BBQ sides warm on the grill, or transferring roasted vegetables from oven to table without cooling down.'
      },
      {
        title: 'BBQ Prep Station',
        content: 'Small metal hotel pans improve outdoor cooking. Use 1/6 pans for burger prep stations, holding grilled vegetables, catching drippings, warming buns, or organizing condiments. The slotted lids let you drain fat from cooked bacon or strain hot grease. Stack them on unused grill space to keep food warm. After 20 years of BBQs, these pans make outdoor cooking feel organized and professional instead of chaotic.'
      },
      {
        title: 'Oven Roasting Reality',
        content: 'For home oven use, 6-inch 1/6 pans are perfect for roasting vegetables for 4-6 people, baking chicken thighs, or making brownies. The stainless steel conducts heat evenly and survives high temperatures. Clean-up is easy: no coating to worry about, just stainless steel that can handle aggressive scrubbing and dishwasher cycles. These work exactly like the pans restaurants use for oven roasting.'
      },
      {
        title: 'Why Both Metal AND Plastic',
        content: 'You need both systems. Plastic hotel pans for refrigerator storage and meal prep. Metal hotel pans for hot food, oven use, and outdoor cooking. They use the same standardized sizing, so a 1/6 lid fits both plastic and metal 1/6 pans. Professional kitchens use both: metal for hot holding and cooking, plastic for cold storage. Bring this same professional system to your home kitchen.'

  // FAQ SCHEMA DATA
  faqData: [
    {
      question: 'Are metal hotel pans oven-safe?',
      answer: 'Yes, up to 500°F+ easily. Stainless steel handles high oven temperatures without warping or damage. I use them for roasting vegetables, baking proteins, and even brownies. The metal conducts heat efficiently for even cooking.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use metal hotel pans in the refrigerator?',
      answer: 'You can, but plastic pans are better for cold storage. Metal takes up more space, conducts cold inefficiently, and isn\'t ideal for long-term refrigerator storage. Use metal for hot food and oven use; use plastic for refrigerator storage and meal prep.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What are slotted lids for?',
      answer: 'Slotted or notched lids have a cutout that lets you keep a ladle or serving spoon IN the pan during hot holding and buffet service. The notch fits standard serving utensils so the spoon handle sticks through while the lid stays mostly closed to maintain heat. This is exactly how restaurants do buffet service, keeping food hot while allowing easy access for serving.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need 1/6 or 1/9 metal pans?',
      answer: 'Start with 1/6 pans (6.75" × 6.25"). They\'re more versatile, perfect for roasting vegetables, holding sides during BBQs, or serving portions for 4-6 people. Only add 1/9 pans if you need smaller portions for condiments, sauces, or individual servings during buffet service.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can metal hotel pans go on the grill?',
      answer: 'Yes, stainless steel handles grill heat. I use them on unused grill space for warming buns, holding cooked vegetables, catching drippings, or keeping finished proteins warm. Don\'t put them directly over high flames long-term, but they\'re perfect for indirect heat zones.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Are they dishwasher safe?',
      answer: 'Yes, stainless steel is fully dishwasher safe, even in commercial dishwashers at high temperatures. I\'ve been washing mine in dishwashers for 20 years with no degradation, discoloration, or rust. The stainless steel actually cleans easier in the dishwasher than by hand.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How long do metal hotel pans last?',
      answer: 'Decades. Restaurant-grade 18-8 stainless steel doesn\'t degrade. No coating to wear off, no rust if properly maintained, no warping from heat. The same pans used in commercial kitchens for 20+ years work identically to new ones. This is buy-it-for-life quality.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use regular lids and slotted lids interchangeably?',
      answer: 'Yes, both fit the same pan size. Use regular lids for hot holding when you want to trap heat and moisture. Use slotted lids when you need drainage (bacon grease, hot liquids) or ventilation. Having both options gives you maximum flexibility for different cooking scenarios.'
