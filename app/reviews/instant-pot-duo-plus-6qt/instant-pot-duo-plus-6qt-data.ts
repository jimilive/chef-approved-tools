        title: 'Pot Roast Test (The Signature Dish)',
        content: `**Setup:** 2.5-pound chuck roast, standard mirepoix, beef stock, pressure cook 75 minutes, natural release 20 minutes.\n\n**Results:** The meat was fall-apart tender, rivaling anything I've made in commercial kitchens. The natural release is key here—it prevents the meat from seizing up and becoming tough. However, the sauté function couldn't properly brown the roast. I ended up removing the mirepoix before pressure cooking because it turned to mush during the extended browning attempt.\n\n**Key finding:** Brown large cuts in a cast iron skillet on the stovetop (takes 3-4 minutes with proper heat), then transfer to the Instant Pot for pressure cooking.`
      },
      {
        title: 'Rice Test (The Daily Driver)',
        content: `**Setup:** 2 cups white rice, 2 cups water, rice setting, natural release 10 minutes.\n\n**Results:** Perfect fluffy rice every single time. This is where the Instant Pot shines for everyday use. No monitoring required, no risk of burning. The rice comes out separate, properly cooked, with consistent texture from top to bottom.\n\n**Why this matters:** In professional kitchens, we use dedicated commercial rice cookers. The Instant Pot delivers comparable rice results with the added benefit of being a multi-function appliance.`
      },
      {
        title: 'Beans & Legumes Test',
        content: `**Setup:** Various dried beans (black beans, chickpeas, pinto beans), no pre-soaking, 30-40 minutes pressure cooking.\n\n**Results:** Dried beans in 30-40 minutes without pre-soaking, and they're creamy inside without being mushy. The Instant Pot eliminates the planning requirement—dried beans to table in under an hour is genuinely convenient.\n\n**Professional context:** In restaurant kitchens, we pre-soak beans overnight and still cook them for 2-3 hours. The Instant Pot cuts that time by 75% while delivering comparable texture.`

        title: 'Professional Context: 24 Years with Commercial Equipment',

The question is whether consumer appliances can apply proper commercial principles or if it's just marketing hype.`

        title: 'The Time Reality: Not Quick, But Convenient',
        content: `This is the most common misconception about pressure cooking. 'Pressure cooking' refers to the active cooking time under pressure, not total time.\n\n**Pot roast example:**\n• Pressurization: 10-15 minutes\n• Cooking time: 75 minutes\n• Natural release: 20 minutes\n• **Total: 105-110 minutes**\n\nThat's still half the time of traditional braising (4-5 hours), but it's not quick cooking—it's convenient hands-off cooking. You can't walk in the door and have dinner in 30 minutes.\n\n**Where it saves time:** You're not monitoring it. Set it, walk away, come back to finished food. For meal prep on Sunday for the week, this is transformative. For weeknight dinners when you get home at 6pm, this won't work.`

      {
        title: 'The Sauté Function Limitation',
        content: `The sauté function is the Instant Pot's biggest weakness. It lacks the heat output for proper Maillard reaction browning on large roasts.\n\n**What happens:** You can brown aromatics (onions, garlic) and ground meat adequately. But a 2.5-pound chuck roast? The heating element can't generate enough heat to create a proper crust. You end up steaming the meat instead of browning it.\n\n**Professional solution:** Brown large cuts in a cast iron skillet on the stovetop (takes 3-4 minutes with proper heat), then transfer to the Instant Pot for pressure cooking. Yes, this dirties two pans. But the flavor development from proper browning is worth it.\n\n**Why this matters:** Maillard reaction (browning) creates hundreds of flavor compounds. Without it, your pot roast tastes boiled instead of roasted.`

      {
        title: 'Capacity Reality: 6 Quarts Isn\'t Actually 6 Quarts',
        content: `The 6-quart capacity is perfect for 4-6 people, but there's a critical limitation: pressure cookers shouldn't be filled more than 2/3 full for liquids or 1/2 full for grains.\n\n**Effective capacity:**\n• Liquids (soups, stews): 4 quarts maximum\n• Grains (rice, quinoa): 3 quarts maximum\n• Beans: 4 cups dried beans maximum\n\n**What this means:** You can fit a 2.5-pound roast, 4 cups of dried beans, or enough rice for 8-10 servings. For families of 4-6 or meal prep for 2-3, this is perfect. For cooking for 1-2 people, the 3-quart Duo Mini makes more sense.`

    {
      question: "Is the Instant Pot Duo Plus worth getting?",
      answer: "After 90 days of daily use, yes—if you cook for 4+ people, meal prep regularly, or frequently make beans, rice, and braised meats. The combination of hands-off convenience, consistent results, and 9-in-1 functionality makes it a valuable addition to the kitchen. However, if you cook for 1-2 people or primarily make quick stovetop meals, you may not use it enough to justify the counter space."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the Instant Pot compare to commercial pressure cookers?",
      answer: "After using commercial pressure equipment for 24 years in professional kitchens, the Instant Pot delivers approximately 70% of professional performance. The natural release function produces genuinely restaurant-quality results for braised meats. However, commercial equipment has more powerful heating elements, faster pressure buildup, and more precise pressure regulation."
    },
    {
      question: "Why does it take so long if pressure cooking is supposed to be fast?",
      answer: "This is the most common misconception. 'Pressure cooking' refers to the active cooking time under pressure, not total time. For a pot roast: 10-15 minutes to come to pressure, 75 minutes cooking time, 20 minutes natural release = 105-110 minutes total. That's still half the time of traditional braising (4-5 hours), but it's not quick cooking—it's convenient hands-off cooking."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use the Instant Pot to brown meat properly?",
      answer: "The sauté function works fine for aromatics and ground meat, but it lacks the heat output for proper Maillard reaction browning on large roasts. My recommendation: brown large cuts in a cast iron skillet on the stovetop (takes 3-4 minutes with proper heat), then transfer to the Instant Pot for pressure cooking."
    },
    {
      question: "Is the 6-quart size big enough?",
      answer: "The 6-quart capacity is perfect for 4-6 people or meal prep for 2-3 people. I can fit a 2.5-pound roast, 4 cups of dried beans, or enough rice for 8-10 servings. However, pressure cookers shouldn't be filled more than 2/3 full for liquids or 1/2 full for grains, so the effective capacity is 4 quarts for most dishes."
    },
    {
      question: "Is the Instant Pot safe? I'm worried about pressure cooker explosions.",
      answer: "The Instant Pot has 10 proven safety mechanisms and is UL certified. Modern electric pressure cookers are dramatically safer than old stovetop models from the 1970s-80s. The lid won't open while under pressure, the pressure release valve is automated, and there are multiple backup systems. In 90 days of daily use, I've had zero safety concerns."
