    verdict: 'After 20 years of daily home use and 24 years in professional kitchens, small plastic hotel pans are the single best kitchen organization upgrade you can make. Every restaurant uses this system because nothing else comes close for functional food storage. No more mismatched lids, no more container avalanches, no more wasted fridge space. The standardized sizing means everything stacks perfectly, lids are always interchangeable, and meal prep becomes easy. These aren\'t fancy. They\'re simply the proven system that professionals trust.',

    sections: [
      {
        title: 'The Problem With Consumer Storage Containers',
        content: 'Consumer storage containers fail because every brand uses different sizes. You end up with mismatched lids, inefficient stacking, wasted space, and constant frustration. After a year, lids crack, containers warp, and you start over with a new set. The hotel pan system solves all of this with standardized sizing used across the entire food service industry.'
      },
      {
        title: 'How Professional Kitchens Stay Organized',
        content: 'Every restaurant I\'ve worked in uses hotel pans because the standardization is non-negotiable for professional operation. When you have 50+ containers in use, they must stack perfectly, lids must be interchangeable, and space must be maximized. Small plastic hotel pans bring this same professional organization to home kitchens. Once you experience it, consumer containers feel chaotic by comparison.'
      },
      {
        title: 'Real Home Meal Prep Workflow',
        content: 'Sunday meal prep: batch-cook proteins in 6-inch 1/6 pans (holds 8-10 chicken thighs or 2 lbs ground beef). Store grains and starches in 4-inch 1/6 pans (each holds about 4 cups cooked rice). Prep vegetables in 4-inch pans. Throughout the week, grab containers and assemble balanced meals in 5 minutes. Everything stacks perfectly in the fridge with no wasted space. The logistics work because the system is designed for efficiency.'
      },
      {
        title: 'Why 1/6 Pans Are the Home Kitchen Sweet Spot',
        content: 'After 20 years of home testing, 6-inch 1/6 pans are the most versatile size. Big enough for real meal prep portions (4-6 servings), compact enough to not dominate your fridge, perfect depth for proteins and grains, easy to handle when full. Start here. Add 4-inch 1/6 pans for shallower storage needs. Only add 1/9 pans if you have specific small-portion requirements.'

  // FAQ SCHEMA DATA
  faqData: [
    {
      question: 'How long do plastic hotel pans last?',
      answer: 'Decades. I\'ve been using the same pans at home for 20 years. They\'re virtually indestructible for normal home use. NSF-certified polypropylene is designed for commercial restaurant environments, so home use is much gentler.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Are they microwave safe?',
      answer: 'Technically yes, but I don\'t recommend it. While the plastic can handle microwave heat, it\'s not ideal for even heating. I transfer food to plates or bowls for reheating. Use hotel pans for storage and meal prep, not for serving or reheating.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I put them in the freezer?',
      answer: 'Yes, they\'re freezer safe. I use them for freezing stock, soups, cooked grains, and meal prep portions. The containers won\'t crack or become brittle in freezer temperatures.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Will they stain from tomato sauce?',
      answer: 'Not the opaque white versions. Avoid translucent or clear plastic which can stain. The solid white plastic resists staining even from tomato sauce, curry, turmeric, and other highly pigmented foods.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need 1/6 or 1/9 pans?',
      answer: 'Start with 1/6 pans. They\'re more versatile for home use, big enough for real portions but not so large they dominate your fridge. Only add 1/9 pans if you have specific small-portion needs like sauces, condiments, or garnishes. The 1/9 pans are narrower and can tip over when full.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How do they compare to glass containers?',
      answer: 'Hotel pans win for lighter weight, won\'t shatter if dropped, better stacking efficiency, and lower cost. Glass wins for microwave reheating and oven use. For meal prep and refrigerator storage, plastic hotel pans are superior. For serving and reheating, glass is better.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How many should I buy?',
      answer: 'For serious meal prep, start with at least one 6-pack of 6-inch 1/6 pans with lids. If you batch-cook weekly, buy two 6-packs (12 pans total). Add one 6-pack of 4-inch 1/6 pans for shallower storage needs. You can always add more as you optimize your system.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Are the lids dishwasher safe?',
      answer: 'Yes, both pans and lids are dishwasher safe, even in commercial dishwashers at 180°F+. I\'ve been washing mine in the dishwasher for 20 years with no warping, cracking, or seal degradation.'
