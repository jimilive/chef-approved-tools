  testingStory: {
    title: 'Why I Bought This Knife',
    paragraphs: [
      'I bought the Wüsthof Classic Ikon Santoku because it was beautiful. That sounds superficial for a professional tool, but after handling dozens of knives at culinary school and in restaurant kitchens, this one felt different the moment I picked it up. The contoured Ikon handle, the elegant granton dimples, the perfect balance—it looked like a knife that belonged in a professional kitchen.',
      'What kept me using it for 14 years wasn\'t the aesthetics. It was the thin blade and that 10-degree edge angle. Coming from standard German chef\'s knives with their 14-degree edges, the difference in slicing was immediately noticeable. Less resistance. Cleaner cuts. Thinner slices with less effort.',
      'At Feierabend, I sliced thousands upon thousands of mushrooms with this knife. German cuisine means mushrooms on everything, and paper-thin slices were non-negotiable. The santoku\'s straight edge and up-and-down motion made quick work of cases of creminis and portobellos. At Purple Café, it handled pizza toppings and vegetable prep for 200+ cover nights.',

    title: 'Performance Analysis: What 14 Years Reveals',
    sections: [
      {
        title: 'The Thin Blade Advantage',
        content: 'The Classic Ikon Santoku\'s blade is noticeably thinner than traditional German chef\'s knives. Combined with the 10-degree edge angle (compared to 14-15 degrees on most German knives), this geometry creates a blade that glides through vegetables with minimal resistance. After 14 years, I still appreciate how smoothly it slices tomatoes, creates paper-thin cucumber rounds, and handles delicate herbs without bruising.',
      },
      {
        title: 'Granton Edge Food Release',
        content: 'The hollow granton dimples along the blade create air pockets that prevent food from sticking. This matters most with starchy vegetables like potatoes and sticky ingredients like soft cheeses. At Feierabend, prepping pounds of potatoes for German potato salad, the granton edge meant slices fell away cleanly instead of climbing up the blade.',
      },
      {
        title: 'The Maintenance Trade-off',
        content: 'Here\'s the honest truth: <LINK>this knife</LINK> requires more care than my Victorinox workhorses. The thinner blade and sharper edge angle mean it\'s more susceptible to damage if you\'re careless. It needs regular honing and careful storage. The granton dimples add slight complexity to sharpening. If you want a knife you can abuse and neglect, this isn\'t it. If you\'re willing to treat it right, it rewards you with performance that thicker blades can\'t match.',
      },
      {
        title: 'Santoku vs. Chef\'s Knife',
        content: 'After using both professionally, I see them as complementary tools, not competitors. The santoku excels at up-and-down chopping motions where the straight edge contacts the board fully. The chef\'s knife excels at rocking cuts and precision tip work. The santoku is faster for high-volume vegetable prep. The chef\'s knife is more versatile for varied tasks. I use both regularly at home.',

  // FAQ data
  faqData: [
    {
      question: 'What does the granton edge actually do?',
      answer: 'The hollow dimples create air pockets between the blade and food, reducing suction and friction so ingredients fall away naturally instead of sticking to the blade. This matters most with starchy vegetables like potatoes and sticky ingredients like soft cheeses.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How does a santoku differ from a chef\'s knife in cutting technique?',
      answer: 'Santokus use an up-and-down vertical chopping motion with the straight edge making full board contact. Chef\'s knives employ a rocking motion using the curved blade. After using both professionally, I find santokus faster for high-volume vegetable prep, while chef\'s knives are more versatile for varied tasks.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is the Classic Ikon harder to sharpen because of the granton dimples?',
      answer: 'Slightly. The dimples add a bit of complexity, but the reduced bolster allows sharpening along the entire blade length, which partially compensates. Regular honing is more important than frequent sharpening—I hone before every use and sharpen only when honing stops restoring the edge.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What steel is the blade made from?',
      answer: 'X50CrMoV15 stainless steel hardened to 58 HRC. This is Wüsthof\'s standard high-carbon stainless, balancing edge retention with corrosion resistance and ease of sharpening. The 10-degree edge angle (compared to 14-15° on standard Wüsthof knives) is what makes the real difference in sharpness.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use this santoku for meat and fish?',
      answer: 'Yes—it performs very well on boneless meats and fish, delivering smooth cuts without tearing delicate flesh. However, the sheepsfoot tip limits precision work like deveining shrimp or scoring meat. For bone-in cuts or heavy butchering, use a chef\'s knife instead.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Why do you say it needs more maintenance than other knives?',
      answer: 'The thinner blade and sharper edge angle make it more susceptible to damage with careless use. It rewards proper care with exceptional performance, but if you\'re rough on knives, drop them in sink drawers, or skip regular honing, you\'ll damage this blade faster than a thicker workhorse like a Victorinox.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I buy this if I already have an 8-inch chef\'s knife?',
      answer: 'Yes—the santoku complements rather than replaces a chef\'s knife. Use the santoku for vegetable-focused prep and rapid chopping where the straight edge and lighter weight shine. Reserve the chef\'s knife for rocking cuts, precision tip work, and general-purpose tasks.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does the edge last between sharpenings?',
      answer: 'With regular honing before each use, I sharpen this knife 2-3 times per year with home use. In professional kitchens with daily heavy use, I sharpened monthly. Wüsthof\'s PEtec technology claims twice the edge retention of standard knives—that\'s been consistent with my experience.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Does Wüsthof offer a warranty?',
      answer: 'Yes—lifetime warranty on Classic Ikon knives. I\'ve never needed to use it in 14 years, which says something about the build quality.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What\'s the best way to store this knife?',
      answer: 'Magnetic strip, knife block, or blade guard in a drawer. Never loose in a drawer where the edge can contact other utensils. The thin blade and sharp edge make proper storage even more important than with thicker knives.',
