  expertOpinion: "After 5 years of daily use and 24 years managing professional kitchens, I've never found a cleaner that combines serious grease-cutting power with genuinely safe, non-toxic ingredients. Method All-Purpose Cleaner is the rare product that refuses to compromise—it cuts through kitchen grease as effectively as harsh chemical cleaners, but it's plant-based, biodegradable, and safe around food prep surfaces.",
  pros: [
    "Effortlessly cuts through grease and grime—equal to chemical cleaners",
    "Non-toxic, plant-based formula safe for food prep areas",
    "Safe for wide variety of kitchen surfaces",
    "Environmentally friendly and biodegradable"
  ],
  cons: [
    "Not intended for heavy-duty outdoor or industrial cleaning",
    "Not a disinfectant (doesn't kill bacteria/viruses)",
    "Slightly more expensive than conventional chemical cleaners"
  ],

const faqData = [
  {
    question: "Is Method All-Purpose Cleaner really non-toxic and safe?",
    answer: "Yes, genuinely non-toxic. The formula is plant-based, biodegradable, and free from harsh chemicals like ammonia, bleach, or phosphates. It's safe to use on food prep surfaces without rinsing. After 5 years of daily use in my kitchen, I've had zero concerns about safety around food, children, or pets. This is as safe as cleaners get while still being effective."
  },
  {
    question: "How does Method compare to traditional cleaners like Formula 409?",
    answer: "Method matches the cleaning power of chemical cleaners like 409 or Fantastik but without harsh fumes, chemical residue, or environmental concerns. After 5 years of testing, I can confidently say Method cuts grease just as effectively. The difference is you can breathe normally while using it, and you don't need to worry about toxic residue on food surfaces. It's the rare product that doesn't compromise power for safety."
  },
  {
    question: "Does Method work well on greasy stovetops?",
    answer: "Exceptionally well. This is where Method truly shines. Spray it on cooking grease splatters, wait 5-10 seconds, and wipe clean—no scrubbing needed. I've watched it dissolve grease that would normally require aggressive scrubbing. For very heavy, baked-on grease, let it sit for 30-60 seconds. This is the primary reason I switched to Method after years of using harsh degreasers."
  },
  {
    question: "Is Method streak-free on stainless steel?",
    answer: "Yes, but technique matters. Clean with Method, then immediately follow with a dry cloth to buff the surface. This prevents water spots and streaking. I use it on all my stainless steel appliances with excellent results. The two-step process (clean, then dry) takes seconds and produces streak-free shine every time."
  },
  {
    question: "Is Method safe for all kitchen surfaces?",
    answer: "Safe for virtually all common kitchen surfaces: countertops (granite, quartz, laminate), stovetops, appliances, glass, stainless steel, sealed wood, tile, and more. I use it on everything from my John Boos cutting board to Le Creuset enamel. Avoid using on unsealed natural stone or unfinished wood. When in doubt, test on a small inconspicuous area first."
  },
  {
    question: "What scent options are available?",
    answer: "Method offers multiple scent options including French Lavender, Pink Grapefruit, Ylang Ylang, Cucumber, and more. All scents are derived from natural fragrances—pleasant but not overwhelming. I personally use Pink Grapefruit, which has a fresh, clean scent that dissipates quickly. Unlike chemical cleaners with artificial perfumes, these natural scents are subtle and enjoyable."
  },
  {
    question: "Are refills available for Method All-Purpose Cleaner?",
    answer: "Yes, Method offers refill bottles that are more economical and environmentally friendly than buying new spray bottles repeatedly. The refills come in larger containers that pour into your existing spray bottle. This reduces plastic waste significantly and saves money long-term. After 5 years, I've been using the same spray bottles with refills—the spray mechanisms hold up remarkably well."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the cost compare to conventional cleaners?",
    answer: "Method costs slightly more per bottle than conventional chemical cleaners (typically a few dollars difference). However, the performance is exceptional, you use less product per cleaning (it's very concentrated), and refills reduce long-term cost. The health and environmental benefits justify the small premium. After 5 years, the cost difference is negligible compared to the value of safe, effective cleaning."
  },
  {
    question: "Is Method effective on baked-on, dried grime?",
    answer: "Yes, but let it sit longer. For normal kitchen messes, 5-10 seconds is enough. For baked-on grime (like microwave splatters or dried stovetop spills), spray generously and let sit 30-60 seconds before wiping. The formula needs time to break down dried residue. Very occasionally, extremely heavy grime may require a second application. Still easier than scrubbing with harsh chemicals."
  },
  {
    question: "Would Method work in a professional kitchen?",
    answer: "For general surface cleaning, absolutely. However, professional kitchens require sanitizers and disinfectants for health department compliance, which Method is not. It's a cleaner, not a sanitizer. In my 24 years managing restaurant kitchens, I would have used Method for general cleaning and degreasing, then followed with approved sanitizers for food contact surfaces. For home kitchens, Method handles everything you need."

            formula gives you confidence that you&apos;re cleaning safely—a must for kitchens where
            food is prepared daily.

          <h2>Eco-Friendly and Non-Toxic: The Real Differentiator</h2>

          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
            One of the standout features of Method All-Purpose Cleaner is its non-toxic formulation.
            After 24 years in professional kitchens, I&apos;ve used every type of cleaner imaginable—from
            harsh industrial degreasers to weak &quot;natural&quot; products that barely work. Method
            is the first cleaner I&apos;ve found that genuinely delivers on both fronts.

          </h3>

          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
            Traditional chemical cleaners like 409 are powerful but come with serious drawbacks:
            harsh fumes, chemical residue on food surfaces, environmental concerns, and potential
            health risks. After 5 years with Method, I can confirm it matches their cleaning
            power without any of those compromises.
          </p>

          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
            <strong>Use Method for:</strong> All kitchen cleaning, especially food prep surfaces<br/>

            Most natural cleaners are disappointingly weak. They smell nice but require extensive
            scrubbing and multiple applications. Method is the rare natural cleaner that actually
            works as well as its chemical competitors. The plant-based formula genuinely cuts
            grease—this isn&apos;t greenwashing, it&apos;s effective chemistry.

            <h3>Is Method All-Purpose Cleaner really non-toxic and safe?</h3>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, genuinely non-toxic. The formula is plant-based,
              biodegradable, and free from harsh chemicals like ammonia, bleach, or phosphates.
              It&apos;s safe to use on food prep surfaces without rinsing. After 5 years of
              daily use in my kitchen, I&apos;ve had zero concerns about safety around food,
              children, or pets. This is as safe as cleaners get while still being effective.

                <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Answer:</strong> Method matches the cleaning power of chemical cleaners
                  like 409 or Fantastik but without harsh fumes, chemical residue, or environmental
                  concerns. After 5 years of testing, I can confidently say Method cuts grease
                  just as effectively. The difference is you can breathe normally while using it,
                  and you don&apos;t need to worry about toxic residue on food surfaces. It&apos;s
                  the rare product that doesn&apos;t compromise power for safety.

                <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Answer:</strong> Exceptionally well. This is where Method truly shines.
                  Spray it on cooking grease splatters, wait 5-10 seconds, and wipe clean—no
                  scrubbing needed. I&apos;ve watched it dissolve grease that would normally require
                  aggressive scrubbing. For very heavy, baked-on grease, let it sit for 30-60 seconds.
                  This is the primary reason I switched to Method after years of using harsh degreasers.

                  <strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, but technique matters. Clean with Method, then
                  immediately follow with a dry cloth to buff the surface. This prevents water
                  spots and streaking. I use it on all my stainless steel appliances with excellent
                  results. The two-step process (clean, then dry) takes seconds and produces
                  streak-free shine every time.

                  <strong>Answer:</strong> Safe for virtually all common kitchen surfaces: countertops

                  <strong>Answer:</strong> Method offers multiple scent options including French
                  Lavender, Pink Grapefruit, Ylang Ylang, Cucumber, and more. All scents are
                  derived from natural fragrances—pleasant but not overwhelming. I personally use
                  Pink Grapefruit, which has a fresh, clean scent that dissipates quickly. Unlike
                  chemical cleaners with artificial perfumes, these natural scents are subtle and
                  enjoyable.

                <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, Method offers refill bottles that are more economical
                  and environmentally friendly than buying new spray bottles repeatedly. The refills
                  come in larger containers that pour into your existing spray bottle. This reduces
                  plastic waste significantly and saves money long-term. After 5 years, I&apos;ve
                  been using the same spray bottles with refills—the spray mechanisms hold up
                  remarkably well.

                <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Answer:</strong> Method costs slightly more per bottle than conventional
                  chemical cleaners (typically a few dollars difference). However, the performance
                  is exceptional, you use less product per cleaning (it&apos;s very concentrated),
                  and refills reduce long-term cost. The health and environmental benefits justify
                  the small premium. After 5 years, the cost difference is negligible compared to
                  the value of safe, effective cleaning.

                <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, but let it sit longer. For normal kitchen messes,
                  5-10 seconds is enough. For baked-on grime (like microwave splatters or dried
                  stovetop spills), spray generously and let sit 30-60 seconds before wiping. The
                  formula needs time to break down dried residue. Very occasionally, extremely
                  heavy grime may require a second application. Still easier than scrubbing with
                  harsh chemicals.

                <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Answer:</strong> For general surface cleaning, absolutely. However,
                  professional kitchens require sanitizers and disinfectants for health department
                  compliance, which Method is not. It&apos;s a cleaner, not a sanitizer. In my
                  24 years managing restaurant kitchens, I would have used Method for general
                  cleaning and degreasing, then followed with approved sanitizers for food contact
                  surfaces. For home kitchens, Method handles everything you need.
