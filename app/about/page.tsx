    question: "What's your professional culinary background?",
    answer: "I hold an A.A.S. in Culinary Arts from Seattle Culinary Academy and a B.S. in Business Administration from University of Montana. I've worked as a certified Pizzaiolo at Purple Caf√© & Wine Bar and managed restaurant operations at Mellow Mushroom with $80K+ monthly revenue, giving me real-world experience with professional kitchen equipment."
  },
  {
    question: "How did you transition from restaurant work to equipment reviews?",
    answer: "After 5+ years in restaurant operations, I moved into e-commerce, working as Internet Production Lead at The Sharper Image and later managing a $2M brand launch. This combination of culinary expertise and e-commerce experience helps me understand both what works in kitchens and what information helps people make purchasing decisions."
  },
  {
    question: "Why should I trust your equipment recommendations?",
    answer: "Every tool gets minimum 6 months of testing in real kitchen environments before I recommend it. No shortcuts, no sponsored quick reviews - just honest evaluation from someone who&apos;s used professional equipment to feed hundreds of customers daily."
