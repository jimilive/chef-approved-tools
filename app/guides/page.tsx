    question: "Are your buying guides updated regularly?",
    answer: "Yes, we update our buying guides quarterly based on new equipment testing, price changes, and availability updates. Each guide shows the last update date, and we notify subscribers when major recommendations change."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you recommend budget alternatives in your guides?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Each guide includes recommendations across different price points, including budget-friendly options that still meet our quality standards. We believe great cooking shouldn't require expensive equipment, just the right equipment for your needs."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you choose which equipment to include in guides?",
    answer: "We only include equipment that has completed our full 6-month testing process in professional kitchens. Every recommendation has been used by real kitchen staff under high-volume conditions, ensuring our guides reflect real-world performance."
