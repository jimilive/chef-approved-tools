              How We Make Money
            </h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Chef Approved Tools is a free resource supported through affiliate partnerships. When you click on certain product links on our site and make a purchase, we may receive a commission from the retailer. This is at <strong>no extra cost to you</strong> â€“ you pay the same price whether you use our link or go directly to the vendor&apos;s website.
            </p>
            <p>
              We primarily participate in the <strong>Amazon Services LLC Associates Program</strong>, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.

              Our Review Process
            </h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Our recommendations are based on:

            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
              <li>Professional kitchen experience (5 years in commercial kitchens)</li>
              <li>Hands-on testing for a minimum of 6 months</li>
              <li>Comparison with similar products in the category</li>
              <li>Real-world performance in high-pressure environments</li>
              <li>Value for money considerations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>We never accept payment for positive reviews.</strong> Products are purchased with our own funds or tested in professional kitchen settings where we work.
