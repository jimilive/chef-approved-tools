    question: "Why Victorinox Instead of Higher-End Knives?",
    answer: "Victorinox Fibrox knives are the America's Test Kitchen winner for a reason. They hold an edge, survive heavy use, and cost a fraction of premium brands. After twenty years, I still haven't found a reason to replace them with something more expensive."
  },
  {
    question: "Do You Still Use All These Tools?",
    answer: "Most of them. The six Victorinox knives are still in my bag. The OXO peeler and bench scraper see daily use. The tongs are the most used of all of them. The Microplane is permanent. The honing steel gets used before every shift. The channel knife and traditional zester? Sitting in my kitchen drawer collecting dust."
  },
  {
    question: "What Would You Add Now That Wasn't on the School List?",
    answer: "A proper instant-read thermometer—something like the Thermapen or Thermoworks models that respond in under two seconds. If you break down salmon, the fish tweezers and a flexible boning or filet knife. A Benriner mandolin and a cut glove are amazing for making veggies beautiful and thin. And more bandaids. Always more bandaids."
  },
  {
    question: "Is This a Complete Kitchen Setup?",
    answer: "No. This is the foundation—the tools that handle prep work and most cooking tasks. You'll eventually need cutting boards, pots, pans, mixing bowls, and measuring equipment. But if you get these eleven tools right, everything else becomes easier."
  },
  {
    question: "Where Should Someone Start If They Can't Afford All Eleven?",
    answer: "Start with the 8\" chef's knife, a paring knife, the peeler, and the bench scraper. Those four tools handle about 80% of daily kitchen work. Add the others as you can afford them."

                This was the cheap version the school recommended. It fits in the little pocket on the arm of a chef coat, where it remained full time until I graduated. I replaced it with better models over the years and learned that thermometers are worth the investment.

              The Third Quarter Addition
            </h2>

            <p className="text-slate-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              By the third quarter, I&apos;d added three things to my knife bag that weren&apos;t on the required list. Two of them were a Ziploc bag of bandaids and a tube of Neosporin Pain.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Everyone asked for bandaids. Constantly. Burns, cuts, blisters from new knife handles—culinary school is rough on hands. I got tired of watching people bleed into paper towels while looking for first aid supplies, so I kept my own stash. And the Neosporin pain, gold for keeping the distraction of burns and cuts from derailing your momentum.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The third was a pair of fish tweezers to remove pin bones from salmon. Indispensable and nothing else besides a pair of pliers works as well.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
              I also started carrying an extra Sharpie. You only forget to bring one to service once before learning that backup tools matter as much as primary ones. I can still hear my chef now, &apos;Bradley, where&apos;s your sharpie!?&apos;

            <p className="text-slate-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Most of these tools are still in my knife bag. The knives have been steeled hundreds of times. The peeler has been replaced once. The bench scraper&apos;s handle is worn smooth. The tongs keep on keeping on.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              But they all still work. They&apos;ve survived culinary school, professional kitchens at Mellow Mushroom and Purple Café, years of various other jobs, and now daily use in my home kitchen.
            </p>

              If you&apos;re starting from scratch—whether you&apos;re heading to culinary school or just tired of fighting with dull knives and flimsy tools—this is what actually matters. Not the expensive knife sets with pieces you&apos;ll never use. Not the gadgets that promise to make cooking easier. Just solid, professional-grade tools that show up when you need them.
