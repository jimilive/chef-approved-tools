## üìß Email Marketing Setup (BLOCKED - Waiting for email signups)

**Status:** ‚è∏Ô∏è ON HOLD - No email list yet

### Tasks to complete once email signups begin:

   - [ ] Create account and integrate with signup forms
   - [ ] Set up API keys in `.env.local`
   - [ ] Configure welcome email sequence
   - [ ] Create lead magnet delivery automation

2. **Contact Form Email Notifications**
   - [ ] Integrate transactional email service (Resend, SendGrid, or AWS SES) for contact form
   - [ ] Configure to send contact form submissions to your inbox
   - [ ] Note: Email Octopus only handles newsletter campaigns, not transactional emails
   - [ ] Update `/app/api/contact/route.ts` with chosen email service

2. **Email Sequences to Create**
   - [ ] Welcome email series (5-7 emails)
   - [ ] Product recommendation emails based on category interest
   - [ ] Newsletter template with kitchen tips + product recommendations
   - [ ] Re-engagement series for inactive subscribers

3. **Compliance Requirements**
   - [ ] Add unsubscribe link to all emails (CAN-SPAM)
   - [ ] Include physical mailing address in footer
   - [ ] Honor unsubscribe requests within 10 days
   - [ ] Maintain double opt-in for GDPR compliance

5. **Forms Currently in Place (Ready to Activate)**
   - ‚úÖ Newsletter signup form on homepage
   - ‚úÖ Exit-intent popup with lead magnet offer
