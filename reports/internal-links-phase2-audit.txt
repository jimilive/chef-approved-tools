INTERNAL LINKS AUDIT - PHASE 2
Strategic Traffic → Conversion Analysis
================================================================================

================================================================================
2.1 HIGH-PRIORITY TRAFFIC → CONVERSION GAPS
================================================================================

Based on traffic analysis, these high-value blog posts should link to reviews:

Blog Post                                    | Should Link To                           | Status

IMPACT: These blogs discuss products we review but don't link to our reviews.
        Readers leave without seeing our product recommendations.

================================================================================
2.2 ORPHAN PAGE DETECTION
================================================================================

--- REVIEWS NOT LINKED FROM ANY BLOG POST (15 total) ---
These reviews have ZERO blog posts linking to them:

❌ black-decker-toaster-oven
❌ cuisinart-dlc-10c-classic-food-processor
❌ henckels-sharpening-steel
❌ instant-pot-duo-plus-6qt
❌ japanese-wooden-spoon-set
❌ kitchenaid-kp26m1xlc-professional-600
❌ kitchenaid-ksm8990wh
❌ ninja-air-fryer-af101
❌ ninja-bl660-professional-blender
❌ oxo-good-grips-swivel-peeler
❌ robot-coupe-r2-dice
❌ victorinox-offset-bread-knife
❌ vitamix-5200-professional-blender
❌ winco-heavy-duty-tongs
❌ wusthof-classic-ikon-16-piece

IMPACT: 15 of 37 reviews (41%) are orphaned - no blog traffic funnels to them.

--- REVIEWS NOT LINKED BACK TO CATEGORY HUB (34 total) ---
92% of review pages don't link back to their category page.

================================================================================
2.3 COMPARISON TABLE LINK AUDIT
================================================================================

Comparison tables exist in these reviews but link EXTERNALLY to Amazon,
not to our internal reviews when we have them:

Review: victorinox-fibrox-8-inch-chefs-knife
  Comparison Table Products:
  - Victorinox Fibrox Pro 8" → Amazon (WE HAVE REVIEW ✓)
  - Mercer Genesis 8" → Amazon (no review)
  - Wüsthof Gourmet 8" → Amazon (similar: wusthof-classic-ikon-16-piece)
  - Mac Professional 8" → Amazon (no review)

  ISSUE: Links go to Amazon even for products we review internally.
         Should add "Read Our Review" links alongside affiliate buttons.

Review: kitchenaid-kp26m1xlc-professional-600
  Comparison Table Products:
  - Professional 600 → Amazon (WE HAVE REVIEW ✓)
  - KSM55 (5.5 Qt) → Amazon (no review)
  - KSM70 (7.0 Qt) → Amazon (no review)
  - Universal Plus → Amazon (no review)

Review: vitamix-5200-professional-blender
  Comparison Table Products:
  - Vitamix 5200 → Amazon (WE HAVE REVIEW ✓)
  - Other blenders → Amazon

  ISSUE: No cross-link to ninja-bl660-professional-blender

OPPORTUNITY: Add internal review links in comparison tables where we have reviews.

================================================================================
2.4 RELATED PRODUCTS / STRATEGIC LINKING GAPS
================================================================================

All review pages have RelatedProductsGrid components, but they pull from
Supabase dynamically. The key issue is:

1. RelatedProductsGrid shows products but doesn't prioritize:
   - Complementary products (knife → cutting board → honing steel)
   - Direct competitors we review (Vitamix → Ninja blender)
   - Upgrade/downgrade paths

STRATEGIC GAPS IDENTIFIED:

Knives Category:
- victorinox-fibrox-8-inch should link to:
  → victorinox-fibrox-10-inch (size comparison)
  → victorinox-4-inch-paring-knife (complementary)
  → henckels-sharpening-steel (maintenance)
  → norton-im200-tri-stone-sharpener (maintenance)

Cookware Category:
- lodge-seasoned-cast-iron should link to:
  → cuisinart-8-inch-nonstick-pan (complementary/alternative)
  → rubbermaid-commercial-cooks-scraper (maintenance tool)

Appliances Category:
- kitchenaid-kp26m1xlc-professional-600 should link to:
  → kitchenaid-ksm8990wh (alternative model comparison)
  → cuisinart-dlc-10c-classic-food-processor (complementary)

Blenders:
- vitamix-5200-professional-blender should link to:
  → ninja-bl660-professional-blender (budget alternative)

================================================================================
PRIORITY ACTION ITEMS
================================================================================

CRITICAL (Revenue Impact):
1. Add review links to cutting-board-materials-guide → epicurean + john-boos
2. Add review links to victorinox-budget-vs-wusthof → victorinox + wusthof reviews
3. Add review links to stand-mixer-buying-guide → kitchenaid reviews
4. Add review links to immersion-blender-vs-countertop → vitamix + ninja

HIGH (Traffic Optimization):
5. Create blog content targeting the 15 orphaned reviews
6. Add "Read Our Review" links in comparison tables
7. Add category hub links to all 34 reviews missing them

MEDIUM (Architecture):
8. Populate relatedGuides and relatedBlogs for /moving-stirring
9. Populate relatedGuides and relatedBlogs for /prep-tools
10. Add strategic cross-links between complementary products
