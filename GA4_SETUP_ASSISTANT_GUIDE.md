## Task Breakdown - What Each One Actually Does

### ✅ 1. Collect website and app data (COMPLETE)
**Status**: Done!
**What it is**: The tracking tag is installed and sending data
**Action needed**: None - you're good!

---

### 🔴 2. Set up key events (CRITICAL - DO THIS)
**Status**: Not started
**What it is**: Mark important events as "conversions"
**Why you need it**: Track when people click your affiliate links!

**How to do it:**

1. Go to: **Admin** → **Events**
2. Wait 24-48 hours for events to appear (need some data first)
3. Find these events and click **"Mark as key event"**:
   - `affiliate_click` ← **Most important!**
   - `newsletter_signup` ← Also important
   - `scroll` (optional, if you want to track engagement)

**What it does**:

**When to do it**: In 2-3 days, once you have some traffic and events showing up

---

### 🟡 3. Turn on Google signals
**Status**: Not started
**What it is**: Use Google account data for cross-device tracking
**Pros**: Better user tracking across devices
**Cons**: Privacy concerns, may reduce data due to consent requirements

**Should you do it?**
- If you want better cross-device tracking: Yes
- If you're privacy-focused: No
- My recommendation: **Skip for now**, revisit in 3-6 months

**How to do it** (if you want):
1. Admin → Data Settings → Data collection
2. Turn on "Google signals data collection"
3. Click "Activate"

---

### 🟢 4. Define audiences
**Status**: Shows "2 audiences" (you already have some defaults)
**What it is**: Segment users by behavior
**Examples**:
- Users who clicked affiliate links
- Users who visited 3+ pages
- Users who signed up for newsletter

**Should you do it?**
- Not urgent
- Useful later for remarketing or analysis
- **Skip for now**, revisit in 1-2 months

**When you're ready:**
1. Admin → Audiences
2. Click "New audience"
3. Create segments like:
   - "Affiliate link clickers" (engaged users)
   - "Newsletter subscribers"
   - "High-value visitors" (3+ page views)

## Your Action Plan

### Do This Week (IMPORTANT)

**Nothing!** Just let data collect.

Wait 2-3 days for events to populate, then:

1. **Set up key events** (most important)
   - Admin → Events
   - Mark `affiliate_click` as key event
   - Mark `newsletter_signup` as key event

### Do This Month (Nice to Have)

2. **Review consent settings**
   - Click "Verify consent settings"
   - Confirm your cookie banner setup
   - Mark as complete

3. **Check if Google signals is needed**
   - Read about pros/cons
   - Decide if cross-device tracking is worth it
   - My recommendation: Skip for now

### Do In 3-6 Months (Optional)

4. **Create audiences** (if useful for analysis)
   - "Affiliate clickers"
   - "Newsletter subscribers"
   - "Repeat visitors"

5. **Consider Google Ads** (if you want to run ads)
   - Link GA4 to Google Ads
   - Set up conversion tracking
   - Create remarketing audiences

---

## What You Can Safely Ignore

✅ **Ignore entirely** (unless running Google Ads):
- Link to Google Ads
- Bid on GA4 conversions
- Target ads to GA4 audiences

✅ **Ignore for now** (revisit later):
- Turn on Google signals (privacy trade-off)
- Define audiences (not urgent)

---

## The ONE Thing You Must Do: Set Up Key Events

**This is critical** because it lets you track your most important metric: **affiliate link clicks**

### Why it matters:
- See conversion rates in reports
- Track which products drive clicks
- Measure ROI of your content
- Understand user behavior

### When to do it:
- Wait 2-3 days for data to collect
- Once you see events in Admin → Events
- Mark `affiliate_click` as key event

### How to verify it's working:
After marking `affiliate_click` as key event:
1. Go to Reports → Engagement → Conversions
2. You should see `affiliate_click` listed
3. Watch the number increment as people click

## How to Think About This

**Google wants you to complete all 8 tasks** because it helps THEM:
- Google signals = more data for Google
- Google Ads linking = you spend money on ads
- Audiences = better ad targeting (more ad revenue)

**You only need to complete tasks that help YOU:**
- ✅ Collect data (done)
- 🔴 Key events (track conversions)
- 🟡 Consent (stay legal)

Everything else is optional or revenue-focused for Google.

---

**Bottom line**: You're 90% done. Just set up key events in 2-3 days and you're good!
