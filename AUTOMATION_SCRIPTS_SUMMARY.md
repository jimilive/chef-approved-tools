### With Scripts
- Short review: 2.5-3 hours each (40% faster)
- Long review: 2-2.5 hours each (33% faster)

```bash
npm run batch-audit > my-audit.txt
# Review the report, plan your week
```

```bash
# Fix all Victorinox knives together
npm run review-fix victorinox-fibrox-8-inch-chefs-knife
npm run review-fix victorinox-fibrox-10-inch-chefs-knife
npm run review-fix victorinox-offset-bread-knife
# Reuse testimonials/content across all 3

grep -n "TODO" app/reviews/<slug>/page.tsx
# Shows all lines needing attention
```

# Add to your workflow
npm run review-validate <slug> && git add . && git commit -m "..."
```

### 5. Check Progress Anytime

## üêõ Common Issues

### "Review not found"
- Check spelling of slug
- List available: `ls app/reviews/`
- Slug must match directory name

### TypeScript errors after fix
- Run `npm run review-fix <slug>` again
- Should fix apostrophes and imports

### Backups accumulating
- Named: `page.tsx.backup-YYYYMMDD`
- Safe to delete after committing
- Keep most recent until verified
