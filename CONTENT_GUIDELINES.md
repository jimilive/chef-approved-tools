# Chef Approved Tools - Content Guidelines

**Last Updated:** November 7, 2025
**Purpose:** Content creation guidelines for writing work
**For:** Blog posts, product reviews, emails, guides

---

## 🎯 Core Philosophy: Encyclopedia vs Friend

**Website = Encyclopedia (Public SEO Content)**
- Comprehensive, objective, educational
- Answers every question completely
- SEO-optimized for Google ranking
- Catches organic traffic, builds authority

**Email = Friend (Subscribers Only)**
- Personal stories from Scott's 24 years
- Specific recommendations, curated advice
- "Here's what I actually use" approach
- Builds relationships, drives conversions

**Example:**
- Website: "Here are 15 cooking oils and their smoke points"
- Email: "I only use 2 oils daily, here's why"

---

## 📜 The 7 Content Mantras

### 1. "Broad on the site, narrow in the inbox"
Blog posts are comprehensive guides. Emails are specific recommendations from 24 years of experience.

### 2. "Every email links back, every blog captures forward"
Emails drive traffic to website (SEO boost + affiliate opportunity).
Blog posts capture emails (relationship building + repeat revenue).

### 3. "SEO feeds the funnel, emails close the sale"
Website content ranks on Google and builds authority.
Email content builds trust and drives specific product purchases.

### 4. "If it's educational, it's public. If it's personal, it's email"
Temperature charts, knife techniques, smoke point tables = blog.
Scott's personal tool choices, Mellow Mushroom stories, "here's what I'd buy" = email.

### 5. "The lead magnet is the shopping list; the emails are the masterclass"
The "11 Tools I Use Most" PDF tells them WHAT to buy.
The email series teaches them WHY it matters and HOW to use it like a pro.

### 6. "Website content answers questions; email content makes decisions"
Blog: "Here are 5 thermometers with pros/cons of each."
Email: "This is THE thermometer I keep in my apron after testing 12 models."

### 7. "Write for Google on the site, write for humans in the inbox"
Blog posts need keywords, structure, headers, comprehensive coverage.
Emails need stories, personality, specific tips, conversational tone.

## 👨‍🍳 Scott's Voice & Credentials

### Professional Background (Get This Right!)
- **24 years professional kitchen experience** ← PRIMARY credential
- **Kitchen Manager for 7 years** over several restaurants
- **45 years total cooking experience** (minimize use of this)
- Positions: Kitchen Manager at Mellow Mushroom, Pizzaiolo at Purple Café, Line Cook at Feierabend, Il Pizzaiolo, Paragary's
- Education: Seattle Central College (Culinary Arts), University of Montana (Business Administration)

**NEVER say:** "Kitchen Manager for 24 years" (it was 7 years)
**ALWAYS say:** "24 years professional kitchen experience"

### Voice Guidelines

**✅ DO Use:**
- First-person perspective ("I've used this for 5 years")
- Specific restaurant references (Purple Café, Mellow Mushroom)
- Professional techniques (blanching, mise en place, brigade system)
- Honest assessments including product limitations
- Real stories from professional kitchens
- Direct, practical language
- "When to use vs when not to use" guidance

**❌ NEVER Use:**
- "Let's dive in"
- "In this comprehensive guide"
- "Without further ado"
- Generic AI phrases
- Fake or invented restaurant stories
- Overly promotional language
- Perfect/flawless product descriptions

**Example of Good Voice:**
> "After 5 years of daily use at Purple Café, the Vitamix 5200 handled everything we threw at it. The only real downside? It's loud enough that we couldn't run it during quiet morning prep without disturbing the dining room."

**Example of Bad Voice:**
> "In this comprehensive guide, we'll dive into the amazing world of blenders. Let's explore why the Vitamix is the perfect choice for your kitchen!"

## 🎯 The Golden Rules

### Rule #1: Scott's Voice is the Differentiator

### Rule #2: Value First, Conversion Second
Solve the problem completely before asking for the sale. Trust drives long-term revenue.

Include real cons and limitations. Perfect reviews feel fake. Honest assessments build trust.

One comprehensive, well-optimized blog post beats five thin, rushed posts every time.

### Rule #5: The User Journey is Circular
Google → Blog → Email signup → Email series → Blog (deeper) → Review → Amazon → Email (follow-up)

### Rule #6: Freshness Signals Authority (NEW)
Regular updates with visible dates show active knowledge management. AI and Google both prioritize fresh, maintained content.

### Rule #7: Comparison Shows Confidence (NEW)
Including comparison tables shows you're confident in your recommendation and provides genuine value even if they choose differently.
