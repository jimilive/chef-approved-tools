# Content Strategy for AI Optimization

## Top 5 Content Tips for AI Optimization

### 01 Build unique "content depth intensity"
Focus on areas that reflect your unique expertise, depth, and niche problem space.

**Application for Chef Approved Tools:**
- Leverage hands-on testing experience (18+ years professional kitchen experience)
- Deep dive into specific use cases and edge cases
- Focus on niche problems (e.g., why specific pan depths matter for buffet service)

---

### 02 Structure is part of storytelling
Consider tables, consistent headings, FAQ blocks, schema markup, and well-anchored claims.

**Application for Chef Approved Tools:**
- ✅ Already using: FAQ schema, product schema, breadcrumb schema
- ✅ Already using: Consistent heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
- ✅ Already using: Structured testing results sections
- ✅ Already using: Tables for specifications and comparisons
- Consider: More comparison tables between competing products

---

### 03 Showing your work builds trust
Support your claims with examples, data, and sources. Content grounded in evidence builds trust.

**Application for Chef Approved Tools:**
- ✅ Already doing: Specific testing periods documented
- ✅ Already doing: Real-world examples from professional kitchen use
- ✅ Already doing: Detailed pros/cons based on actual experience
- Consider: Adding photos of products in actual use
- Consider: Including specific measurements and test results

---

### 04 Context rules
Go beyond basic facts. Explain why it matters, when it matters, and what to watch for. Truly understand your users.

**Application for Chef Approved Tools:**
- ✅ Already doing: "Who Should Buy" sections explain context
- ✅ Already doing: "Consider Alternatives If..." sections
- ✅ Already doing: Specific use case recommendations

---

### 05 Freshness is not a gimmick – it is governance
Treat content refresh, consistent update cadence as part of knowledge lifecycle management.

**Application for Chef Approved Tools:**
- Current: Using ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) with 1-hour cache
- Consider: Regular review schedule for product updates
- Consider: Noting when reviews were last updated
- Consider: Updating reviews when product versions change
- Consider: Annual re-testing of key products
