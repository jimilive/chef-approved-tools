## Common Indexing Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "Discovered - Currently not indexed" in GSC
**Fix**: Request indexing manually for those specific URLs. Google may need more time or backlinks to prioritize them.

### Issue: "Crawled - Currently not indexed"
**Fix**: Page is low quality in Google's view. Add more unique content, more internal links, or build external backlinks.

### Issue: "Page with redirect"
**Fix**: Ensure all URLs are canonical (www vs non-www, http vs https). Your site correctly uses https://www.chefapprovedtools.com.

### Issue: No indexing after 2+ weeks
**Fix**:
1. Check robots.txt isn't blocking
2. Verify sitemap is valid XML
3. Ensure meta robots tags aren't set to "noindex"
4. Build 3-5 quality backlinks from relevant sites

## Questions?

If you encounter indexing issues:
1. Check Google Search Console "Coverage" tab for specific error messages
2. Use "URL Inspection" tool to see exactly what Google sees
3. Verify your sitemap at: https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/validate-xml-sitemap.html

Your site is technically perfect (100/100 Lighthouse, proper schema, clean code), so indexing should be smooth. The main variable is time - be patient, keep creating quality content, and monitor your progress weekly.
