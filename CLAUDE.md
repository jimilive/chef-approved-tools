# Project Rules for Claude

## Git Operations
- Always ask for explicit approval before running `git commit` or `git push`
- Never commit or push without user confirmation

## Scripts and Automation
- Never use scripts (bash loops, perl one-liners, sed/awk automation, etc.) without explicit user approval first
- When bulk changes are needed, make edits individually using the Edit tool unless the user explicitly approves a scripted approach
