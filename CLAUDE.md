# Project Rules for Claude

## IMPORTANT: Before Starting Any Work
- Read START_HERE.md before any work
- NO CHANGES without explicit approval

## Git Operations
- Always ask for explicit approval before running `git commit` or `git push`
- Never commit or push without user confirmation

## Scripts and Automation
- Never use scripts (bash loops, perl one-liners, sed/awk automation, etc.) without explicit user approval first
- When bulk changes are needed, make edits individually using the Edit tool unless the user explicitly approves a scripted approach

## Protected Values
- 24 years professional kitchen experience (not "Kitchen Manager for 24 years")
- Amazon tag: chefapprovedt-20
- CTA text: "Check Price on Amazon" (if linking to Amazon)
