## Next Steps (Optional Optimizations)

### Complete Setup Assistant Tasks
The 7 remaining setup tasks in GA4 are optional but recommended:

1. **Turn on Google signals** - Better cross-device tracking
2. **Set up key events** - Mark important conversions (affiliate_click)
3. **Define audiences** - Segment users by behavior
4. **Verify consent settings** - GDPR compliance check
5. **Link to Google Ads** - If running ads
6. **Bid on GA4 conversions** - If using Google Ads
7. **Target ads to GA4 audiences** - If using Google Ads

### Most Important Next Step: Set Up Key Events (Conversions)

1. Go to: **Admin** → **Events**
2. Find event: `affiliate_click`
3. Click **Mark as key event** (or "Mark as conversion")
4. This will track affiliate clicks as conversions

Do the same for:
- `newsletter_signup`
- Any other events important to your business

## Monitoring Recommendations

### Daily (First Week)
- Check **Realtime** report to ensure data is flowing
- Verify events are firing correctly

### Weekly (Ongoing)
- Review **Engagement** → **Overview** for traffic trends
- Check **Engagement** → **Events** for custom event data
- Review **Acquisition** → **Traffic acquisition** to see where users come from

### Monthly
- Deep dive into user behavior
- Analyze which products get most affiliate clicks
- Review scroll depth to optimize content length
- Check mobile vs desktop performance

## Files Updated

- ✅ `.env.local` - Updated with G-819D3VNNGD
- ✅ Production site - Already had correct ID in Vercel
- ✅ No code changes needed - Implementation was already correct

## Documentation Files

- `GA_TRACKING_FIX.md` - Detailed fix instructions
- `VERCEL_GA_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Vercel environment setup guide
- `GA_TRACKING_STATUS.md` - This file (current status)

## Consent Management Note

Your site currently has consent set to "denied" by default:
```javascript
gtag('consent', 'default', {
  'analytics_storage': 'denied',
  'ad_storage': 'denied'
});
```

This means:
- Users must accept cookies via the Cookie Consent banner
- Once accepted, tracking starts
- This is GDPR/CCPA compliant

If you want to track ALL users (and you're confident it's legal for your jurisdiction):
- You could change 'denied' to 'granted'
- But current setup is more privacy-friendly and legally safer
