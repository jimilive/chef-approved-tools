# Amazon Affiliate Links Audit Report

- **21 Direct Amazon.com Links** (with ASINs)
- **24 Amzn.to Short Links** (need ASIN resolution)
- **Link Tracker Reports: 34 links**

### CRITICAL ISSUE: Link Format Non-Compliance ‚ö†Ô∏è

Most links use ASIN-only format: `https://www.amazon.com/dp/ASIN?tag=chefapprovedt-20`

**This format is NOT one of the two approved Amazon Associates link types and may not properly track commissions.**

**Note:** Amzn.to links ARE valid Amazon Associates links. They automatically include your affiliate tag when created through Amazon Associates. However, we should verify they're not duplicates of the direct links.

---

## Link Tracker Analysis

Your link tracker reports **34 unique links**, which is less than the 46 we found because:

1. **It counts by unique ASIN**, not URL instances
2. **Some amzn.to links point to the same ASINs as direct links** (duplicates)
3. **The tracker may exclude certain pages** (test pages, backups)

The tracker is correctly showing unique products, not URL instances.

## Recommendations

### üö® URGENT: Fix Link Format Compliance

**Priority 1:** Convert all ASIN-only links to proper Amazon Associates format.

**Option A: Use SiteStripe Format (Recommended)**
```typescript
// Current (non-compliant):
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008M5U1C2?tag=chefapprovedt-20

// Fixed (compliant):
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008M5U1C2?tag=chefapprovedt-20&linkCode=ll1&linkId=[unique-id]
```

**Option B: Use Full Product Link Format**
```typescript
// Example:
https://www.amazon.com/Victorinox-Fibrox-8-Inch-Chefs-Knife/dp/B008M5U1C2?tag=chefapprovedt-20
```

### How to Get Proper Links from Amazon Associates:

1. Go to https://associates.amazon.com/
2. Use **SiteStripe** toolbar on any Amazon product page
3. Click "Get Link" ‚Üí "Text" or "Text and Image"
4. Copy the generated link (includes linkCode and linkId)
5. **Always use these generated links** - never manually construct them

### Priority 2: Resolve Amzn.to Links

Create a mapping of which amzn.to links correspond to which ASINs to:
- Identify duplicate products
- Ensure consistent linking
- Verify all short links are working

### Priority 3: Update Link Tracking

Expand the link checker to test all 46 unique products:
- Update `/app/api/check-links/route.ts`
- Add all ASINs to monitoring
- Set up weekly automated checks

---

## Impact of Non-Compliant Links

Using ASIN-only links without `linkCode` parameter may result in:

1. ‚ùå **Lost commissions** - Amazon may not properly attribute clicks
2. ‚ùå **No detailed tracking** - Can't track performance by link type
3. ‚ùå **Program compliance issues** - Amazon Associates terms require proper link format
4. ‚ùå **Account risk** - Sustained non-compliance could affect account standing
