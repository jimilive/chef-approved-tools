# Part 1: Content Strategy

## 🎯 Core Philosophy: Encyclopedia vs Friend

This is the foundational content strategy that drives all decisions about what goes where.

### Website = Encyclopedia (Public SEO Content)

**Purpose:** Catch organic traffic, build authority, educate comprehensively

**Characteristics:**
- Comprehensive, objective, educational
- Answers every question completely
- SEO-optimized for Google ranking
- Professional credibility establishes authority
- Educational focus over personal storytelling

**Content Types:**
- Blog posts (how-to guides, technique tutorials, comparison posts)
- Product reviews (detailed testing, pros/cons, recommendations)
- Category guides (comprehensive buying guides)
- Resource pages (glossaries, reference materials)

**Voice:**
- Professional but conversational
- Credible through experience (not personal anecdotes)
- First-person perspective establishing expertise
- Educational and actionable

**Example:**
- Website: "Here are 15 cooking oils and their smoke points, when to use each, and why it matters in professional kitchens."

---

### Email = Friend (Subscribers Only)

**Purpose:** Build relationships, drive specific purchases, provide curated advice

**Characteristics:**
- Personal stories from Scott's 24 years
- Specific recommendations and curated advice
- "Here's what I actually use" approach
- Storytelling and personality-driven
- Narrow focus (one tool, one technique, one tip)

**Content Types:**
- Onboarding sequence (13-week nurture)
- Product recommendations (specific picks)
- Personal stories (restaurant experiences)
- Behind-the-scenes insights
- Exclusive tips and techniques

**Voice:**
- Conversational and personal
- Story-driven with restaurant anecdotes
- "Let me tell you about the time..." format
- Direct recommendations ("buy this one")

**Example:**
- Email: "I only use 2 oils in my home kitchen daily. Here's why—and the story about when I learned this lesson at Purple Café."

---

## 📜 The 7 Content Mantras

These mantras guide every content decision across the site.

### 1. "Broad on the site, narrow in the inbox"

**Website:** Comprehensive guides covering all options  
**Email:** Specific recommendations from 24 years of experience

**Why it matters:** SEO requires comprehensive coverage. Email subscribers want curated picks.

---

### 2. "Every email links back, every blog captures forward"

**Emails drive traffic to website:**
- SEO boost (more pageviews, lower bounce rate)
- Affiliate opportunity (link to reviews)
- Authority building (educational content)

**Blog posts capture emails:**
- Relationship building (email subscribers)
- Repeat revenue (nurture sequence)
- Long-term customer value

**Implementation:** Every email includes 1-2 website links. Every blog post includes 1 email capture CTA.

---

### 3. "SEO feeds the funnel, emails close the sale"

**Website content:**
- Ranks on Google for informational queries
- Builds topical authority
- Drives new traffic
- Educates and establishes credibility

**Email content:**
- Builds trust and relationship
- Drives specific product purchases
- Higher conversion rate (warm audience)
- Repeat purchases from subscribers

**Strategy:** Use website to attract → Use email to convert

---

### 4. "If it's educational, it's public. If it's personal, it's email"

**Website gets:**
- Temperature charts and reference tables
- Knife sharpening techniques
- Smoke point comparisons
- Professional methods and best practices
- Comprehensive equipment guides

**Email gets:**
- Scott's personal tool choices
- Mellow Mushroom and Purple Café stories
- "Here's the ONE knife I'd buy today"
- Behind-the-scenes restaurant experiences
- Personal recommendations and advice

**Rule:** Educational content ranks. Personal stories convert. Keep them separate.

---

### 5. "The lead magnet is the shopping list; the emails are the masterclass"

**Lead Magnet ("11 Tools I Use Most" PDF):**
- Tells them WHAT to buy
- Quick reference guide
- Immediate value delivery
- Gets the email signup

**Email Nurture Sequence:**
- Teaches them WHY it matters
- Shows them HOW to use it like a pro
- Builds relationship and trust
- Drives purchases over 13 weeks

**Flow:** Lead magnet → Email sequence → Product purchases → Repeat customer

---

### 6. "Website content answers questions; email content makes decisions"

**Website (Blog/Review):**
- "Here are 5 thermometers with pros/cons of each"
- "Comparison: Carbon steel vs stainless steel knives"
- "How to choose the right Dutch oven size"
- Comprehensive, objective, all options covered

**Email:**
- "This is THE thermometer I keep in my apron after testing 12 models"
- "I only use carbon steel. Here's why."
- "Buy the 7-quart Dutch oven. Trust me."
- Specific, opinionated, decision-making

**Why:** Google searches want options. Email subscribers want recommendations.

---

### 7. "Write for Google on the site, write for humans in the inbox"

**Blog posts need:**
- Keywords, structure, headers
- Comprehensive coverage
- Internal links
- SEO optimization
- FAQ sections
- Schema markup

**Emails need:**
- Stories, personality, specific tips
- Conversational tone
- One main idea
- Clear call-to-action
- No SEO requirements

**Balance:** Website = algorithm-friendly + human-readable. Email = purely human connection.

---

## 💰 Pricing Guidelines (All Content)

**CRITICAL RULE:** NEVER include specific prices in any content.

### ❌ NEVER Say:

- "$49.99" or any specific dollar amount
- "$199.95" or exact pricing
- "Currently priced at $129"
- "Was $150, now $99"
- "budget-friendly option"
- "costs the same as two lattes"
- "The cost difference is minimal—just a few cents"

### ✅ ALWAYS Say Instead:

**For Durable Goods:**
- "Lasted 18 years of continuous professional and home use"
- "Still performing like new after 6 years in a 200+ cover restaurant"
- "Professional-grade construction means decades of use"
- "No replacement parts needed in 10 years"
- "Used daily at Purple Café for 6 years without failure"
- "Expect 15-20 years of home use based on restaurant testing"

**For All Products:**
- Quality discussions (without tying to price)
- Durability and longevity
- Professional vs consumer quality
- Build quality affecting lifespan
- Maintenance requirements (general)

### Why This Matters:

1. **Prices change constantly** - Creates maintenance burden
2. **We're not a retailer** - Amazon shows current pricing
3. **Anchoring issues** - Specific prices influence perception
4. **Amazon TOS compliance** - Specific pricing may violate terms
5. **Affiliate links show prices** - Redundant information

### Exception for Consumables:

**Consumables (salt, spices, oils) get used up:**
- Focus on quality and performance
- Focus on usage and applications
- DON'T discuss longevity/ROI (doesn't apply)
- DON'T discuss price at all

---

## 🔗 Internal Linking Strategy

### Blog Post Linking

**Every blog post must include:**
- 3-5 internal links to related product reviews
- 2-3 internal links to related blog posts
- 1 link to a category/guide page (if applicable)

**Anchor Text Best Practices:**
- ✅ Descriptive: "Victorinox chef's knife review"
- ✅ Natural: "I've tested dozens of thermometers over 24 years"
- ❌ Generic: "click here"
- ❌ Over-optimized: "best chef knife professional kitchen equipment"

**Placement:**
- Naturally within content where relevant
- Not forced or awkward
- Contextually related to surrounding content

---

### Product Review Linking

**Every product review must include:**
- 3-4 related product reviews (complementary or alternative items)
- 1-2 related blog posts (technique guides, buying guides)
- 1 category page link

**Related Products Section:**
- Show 3-4 products that pair well or serve similar purpose
- Brief explanation of why they're related
- Clear visual presentation (cards with images)

---

## 📧 Email Capture Strategy

### Placement

**Blog Posts:**
- One email capture CTA per post
- Placed after delivering value (40-60% through post)
- Not intrusive (inline, not popup)

**Product Reviews:**
- One EmailCaptureSection component
- Placed after performance analysis, before bottom line
- Consistent placement across all reviews

**Category Pages:**
- One email capture section
- Placed after initial product grid
- Before detailed comparison tables

# Part 2: Review Page System

**Last Updated:** November 10, 2025  
**Purpose:** Complete guide for creating product review pages  
**Gold Standard:** `/app/reviews/benriner-large-mandoline/page.tsx`

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Review Page Voice Rules

**Reviews use ENCYCLOPEDIA voice (from Part 1)

### ✅ DO Use in Reviews:
- **Professional observations:** "Professional experience shows..."
- **Generic professional context:** "In commercial kitchens..." or "In high-volume settings..."
- **Standard credential:** "24 years of professional kitchen experience"
- **Specific test results:** "Tested for 6 months" or "Used daily for 2 years"
- **Honest pros and cons:** Based on actual testing
- **Technical analysis:** Performance, durability, specifications

### Why This Matters:
- Reviews = PUBLIC content for Google ranking (Encyclopedia)

---

## 🎯 Quick Reference: What, When, Why

**What:** Standardized component-based system for all product review pages

**When:** Every time you review a product (Tier 1, 2, or 3)

**Why:**
- Consistent user experience across all reviews
- Easy maintenance (update component = updates all pages)
- Proper SEO and accessibility built-in
- Clean, maintainable code (300-450 lines vs 900-1000)
- Higher conversion rates (research-backed component order)

**Key Principle:** Separate data (content) from presentation (components)

---

## 📋 Component Order (Follow Exactly)

Review pages MUST use components in this exact order:

```tsx
export default async function ReviewPage() {
  return (
    <>
      {/* 1. TRACKING */}
      <ProductViewTrackerWrapper slug={productData.slug} />
      
      {/* 2. BREADCRUMBS */}
      <Breadcrumb items={breadcrumbItems} />
      
      {/* 3. DATES */}
      <div className="text-sm text-slate-600 mb-2">
        <time dateTime={publishedDate}>Published: {formatDate(publishedDate)}</time>
        {' • '}
        <time dateTime={updatedDate}>Updated: {formatDate(updatedDate)}</time>
      </div>
      
      {/* 4. HERO SECTION */}
      <ReviewHero {...heroData} />
      
      {/* 5. CTA TRACKING */}
      <CTAVisibilityTracker />
      
      {/* 6. TESTING RESULTS */}
      <TestingResultsGrid results={testingResults} />
      
      {/* 7. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS */}
      <PerformanceAnalysis sections={performanceSections} />
      
      {/* 8. COMPARISON TABLE (if applicable) */}
      <ProductComparisonTable products={comparisonProducts} highlightedProduct={productName} />
      
      {/* 9. PROS & CONS */}
      <ProsConsGrid pros={prosData} cons={consData} />
      
      {/* 10. WHO SHOULD BUY */}
      <WhoShouldBuyGrid items={whoShouldBuyData} />
      
      {/* 11. FAQ */}
      <FAQSection faqs={faqData} />
      
      {/* 12. EMAIL CAPTURE */}
      <EmailCaptureSection />
      
      {/* 13. BOTTOM LINE */}
      <BottomLineSection content={bottomLineContent} />
      
      {/* 14. RELATED PRODUCTS */}
      <RelatedProductsGrid products={relatedProducts} />
      
      {/* 15. AUTHOR BIO */}
      <AuthorBio />
    </>
  );
}
```

**Why this order matters:**
- Hero → CTA tracking → Content creates natural user flow
- Email capture AFTER value delivery (not at top)
- Author bio at end (proves authority after content demonstrates it)
- Related products after main content (keeps users engaged)

## 🗄️ Supabase Requirements

### Product Data in Supabase

Every product MUST have these fields in `products` table:

| Field | Type | Required | Example |
|-------|------|----------|---------|
| id | UUID | Yes | Auto-generated |
| slug | string | Yes | `vitamix-5200-professional-blender` |
| name | string | Yes | `Vitamix 5200 Professional Blender` |
| brand | string | Yes | `Vitamix` |
| rating | number | Yes | `5` (1-5 scale) |
| affiliate_url | string | Yes | `https://amzn.to/...` |
| image_url | string | Yes | `/images/products/vitamix-5200.jpg` |
| category | string | Yes | `appliances` |
| tier | number | Yes | `1`, `2`, or `3` |
| testing_period | string | Yes | `6 years professional use` |

### Fetching Product Data

**Pattern 1: Core Review Pages (No Fallback)**
```tsx
const product = await getProductBySlug('product-slug')
if (!product) throw new Error('Product not found: product-slug')
const affiliateUrl = getPrimaryAffiliateLink(product)
```

**When to use:** Any dedicated product review page

**Pattern 2: Multi-Product Pages (With Fallbacks)**
```tsx
const product = await getProductBySlug('product-slug')
const affiliateUrl = product 
  ? getPrimaryAffiliateLink(product) 
  : 'https://amzn.to/fallback'
```

**When to use:** Guide pages, category pages, blogs mentioning products

### ISR Configuration

**CRITICAL:** Use ISR caching, NOT force-dynamic

```tsx
export const revalidate = 3600        // 1 hour cache
export const fetchCache = 'force-cache'
```

**Why:** Better performance, lower database load, faster page loads

# Part 3: Blog Post System

**Last Updated:** November 10, 2025  
**Purpose:** Complete guide for creating blog posts  
**Status:** Two distinct patterns (X vs Y and Educational)

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Blog Post Voice Rules

**Blog posts use ENCYCLOPEDIA voice (from Part 1) - NOT personal stories!**

### ✅ DO Use in Blog Posts:
- **Professional observations:** "Professional experience shows..."
- **Generic professional patterns:** "In commercial settings..." or "Professional kitchens typically..."
- **Standard credential:** "24 years of professional kitchen experience"
- **Technical comparisons:** Feature analysis, performance data
- **Professional insights:** Based on testing and expertise
- **Educational content:** How-tos, guides, explanations

### ❌ DO NOT Use in Blog Posts:
- **Personal anecdotes:** "When I worked at..." or "In my kitchen..."
- **Specific restaurant names:** "At Purple Café..." or "During my time at Mellow Mushroom..."
- **Personal stories:** "I remember when..." or "My journey with..."
- **Family mentions:** "My wife uses..." or "My family prefers..."
- **Personal buying journeys:** "When I first bought..." or "Over the years I..."

### Why This Matters:
- Blog posts = PUBLIC content for SEO (Encyclopedia voice)
- Personal stories = PRIVATE content for subscribers (Email voice - Friend)
- Keeping them separate maintains content strategy

**Personal stories and restaurant names belong in EMAILS, not blog posts!**

---

## 🎯 Blog Post Types: Two Distinct Patterns

Chef Approved Tools uses **TWO patterns** for blog posts:

**Pattern A: Direct Comparisons (X vs Y)**
- Format: "[Product A] vs [Product B]"
- Structure: Data-driven with comparison components
- Use case: ONLY when comparing exactly 2 specific products
- Example: "Wüsthof vs Shun Chef's Knives: Which is Better?"

**Pattern B: Educational Content (Everything Else)**
- Format: Guides, lists, how-tos, explanations
- Structure: Component-based with inline content
- Use case: ALL blog posts that aren't X vs Y comparisons
- Examples: "How to Sharpen Kitchen Knives", "5 Best Cast Iron Pans for Pizza"

---

## 🌳 Decision Tree: Which Pattern to Use?

```
Am I comparing EXACTLY TWO specific products?
├─ YES → Pattern A (X vs Y Comparison)
│         Examples:
│         • "KitchenAid vs Cuisinart Stand Mixers"
│         • "Lodge vs Le Creuset Dutch Ovens"
│         • "Vitamix 5200 vs 7500"
│
└─ NO → Pattern B (Educational Content)
          Examples:
          • "Best Chef's Knives Under $100"
          • "How to Season Cast Iron"
          • "What Makes a Good Pizza Stone"
          • "5 Essential Tools for Bakers"
```

**Critical Rule:** Pattern A is ONLY for direct product-to-product comparisons (X vs Y format).

---

## 📝 Pattern A: Direct Comparisons (X vs Y)

### When to Use Pattern A

✅ **Use Pattern A when:**
- Comparing exactly 2 specific products
- Title follows "X vs Y" format
- Need side-by-side comparison table
- Need direct feature-by-feature analysis

❌ **Don't use Pattern A for:**
- Lists ("5 Best...", "Top 10...")
- How-to guides
- Explanatory content
- Comparisons of 3+ products
- Category overviews

### Pattern A Structure

**Required Components (in this exact order):**

1. **BlogLayout** - Wrapper component with metadata
2. **BlogHero** - Title, subtitle, dates, author, image
3. **ComparisonSummary** - Quick verdict and winner badge
4. **ComparisonTable** - Side-by-side feature comparison
5. **DetailedAnalysis** - In-depth comparison sections
6. **BlogEmailCapture** - Email signup (middle of post)
7. **FinalVerdict** - Recommendation and decision guide
8. **BlogAuthorBio** - Author credentials
9. **RelatedPosts** - Internal linking

### Pattern A Data Structure

**Location:** `/data/blog/[slug].ts`

```typescript
export const comparisonData = {
  // Basic Metadata
  title: "KitchenAid vs Cuisinart Stand Mixers: Which is Better?",
  slug: "kitchenaid-vs-cuisinart-stand-mixers",
  category: "Stand Mixers",
  publishedDate: "2025-01-15",

### Pattern A Voice Guidelines

**Critical Rules:**
- Use Scott's professional experience (24 years, specific restaurants)
- Include specific testing details (how long, what recipes, results)
- Be honest about both products - no fake objectivity
- Reference actual prices (approximate is fine)
- Link to individual review pages when they exist

**Example Opening:**
> "After testing both the KitchenAid Artisan and Cuisinart SM-50 for 2+ years in my home baking—making bread dough weekly, pizza dough monthly, and cookie dough for family events—the differences became clear. The KitchenAid's metal gears never struggled with stiff bread dough, while the Cuisinart occasionally strained on the same recipes."

      {/* Introduction Section */}
      <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
        <p>
          After 24 years in professional kitchens—including 6 years at Purple 
          Café in Seattle—I've sharpened thousands of knives. At Mellow Mushroom, 
          where I was Kitchen Manager from 1992-1994, we sharpened every station 
          knife at the start of each shift.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most home cooks think knife sharpening is complicated. It's not. You 
          need three things: the right tools, consistent angle, and patience. 
          Here's exactly how to do it.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* Main Content Sections */}
      <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none mt-8">
        <h2>Understanding Knife Sharpening vs Honing</h2>
        
        <p>
          Before you start, understand the difference. At Purple Café, we honed 
          knives multiple times per shift but only sharpened them weekly.
        </p>

        <h3>Honing (Daily Maintenance)</h3>
        <p>
          Honing realigns the knife's edge without removing metal...

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        
        <p>
          After 24 years of sharpening knives in professional kitchens, I can tell 
          you this: knife sharpening isn't complicated, but it does require practice.

# Part 4: SEO Standards

**Last Updated:** November 10, 2025  
**Purpose:** SEO requirements for titles, metas, schema, and encoding  
**For:** All page types (reviews, blogs, guides, categories)

---

## 📝 Title Tag Requirements

### Standards

- **Character limit:** 55-60 characters maximum
- **Uniqueness:** Must be <80% similar to other title tags on site
- **Format:** Include primary keyword + benefit/hook
- **Placement:** In page metadata and schema markup

### Title Tag Best Practices

**DO:**
- ✅ Include primary keyword naturally
- ✅ Include benefit or unique angle
- ✅ Use numbers when relevant (years, testing period)
- ✅ Front-load important keywords
- ✅ Match user search intent
- ✅ Create curiosity or urgency

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Exceed 60 characters (gets truncated)
- ❌ Use same template for every page
- ❌ Keyword stuff or use unnatural language
- ❌ Use special characters that break (see encoding section)
- ❌ Make promises you can't keep

### Uniqueness Testing for Titles

**Critical:** Titles must be <80% similar to other page titles.

**How to test:**
1. Count total words in title
2. Count matching words with other titles
3. Calculate: matching words ÷ total words
4. Must be less than 0.80 (80%)

**Example - PASS:**
- Title A: "Vitamix 5200 Review: 6 Years Professional Testing" (7 words)
- Title B: "Blendtec Designer Review: 3 Years Home Testing" (7 words)
- Matching: "Review", "Years", "Testing" (3 words)
- Similarity: 3/7 = 0.43 (43%) ✅ PASS

**Example - FAIL:**
- Title A: "Vitamix 5200 Review: Professional Kitchen Testing" (6 words)
- Title B: "Vitamix A3500 Review: Professional Kitchen Testing" (6 words)
- Matching: "Vitamix", "Review", "Professional", "Kitchen", "Testing" (5 words)
- Similarity: 5/6 = 0.83 (83%) ❌ FAIL

---

## 📋 Meta Description Requirements

### Standards

- **Character limit:** 150-160 characters (sweet spot)
- **Uniqueness:** Must be <80% similar to other meta descriptions
- **Format:** Benefit + credentials + call to action
- **Tone:** Direct, benefit-focused, persuasive

```

### Meta Description Best Practices

**DO:**
- ✅ Include professional credentials (24 years)
- ✅ Include specific testing period or context
- ✅ Include benefit or key finding
- ✅ Use active, persuasive language
- ✅ Fill 150-160 character range (don't leave space unused)
- ✅ Include call to action or next step

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Copy-paste template and only swap product name
- ❌ Use same opening for multiple pages
- ❌ Exceed 160 characters (gets truncated)
- ❌ Go under 150 characters (wasted opportunity)
- ❌ Forget to include credentials
- ❌ Make unsubstantiated claims

### Uniqueness Testing for Meta Descriptions

**Critical:** Meta descriptions must be <80% similar to others.

**Method same as titles:** Count words, calculate similarity ratio, must be <0.80.

**Solutions for high similarity:**
- Vary the opening (don't always use "Professional chef with 24 years")
- Use different benefit statements
- Include different testing contexts
- Vary the credential phrasing

---

## 🔤 Character Encoding Requirements

### The Problem

Unescaped quotes, apostrophes, and special characters can break:
- Title tags (appear as broken text in search results)
- Meta descriptions (get truncated at special character)
- JSON schema markup (causes validation errors)
- URLs (create 404 errors)

### Solution: Always Escape Special Characters

**In TypeScript/JSX Metadata:**
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Unescaped apostrophe
export const metadata = {
  title: "Scott's Guide to Chef Knives",
  description: "Learn what professional chefs don't tell you."
}

// ✅ CORRECT - Use proper JavaScript string handling
export const metadata = {
  title: "Scott's Guide to Chef Knives", // Curly apostrophe works
  description: "Learn what professional chefs don't tell you."
}

// ✅ ALSO CORRECT - Template literals
export const metadata = {
  title: `Scott's Guide to Chef Knives`,
  description: `Learn what professional chefs don't tell you.`
}
```

### Common Characters to Handle

| Character | Issue | Solution |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Apostrophe (') | Can break strings | Use curly apostrophe (') or template literals |
| Quote (") | Can break strings | Use curly quotes ("") or escape properly |
| Ampersand (&) | Can break in URLs/XML | Use &amp; in HTML, or avoid in titles |
| Em dash (—) | Display issues | Use &mdash; or regular hyphen (-) |

---

## 📜 Schema Markup Requirements

### Required Schema Types by Page

**Product Review Pages:**
- Product schema
- Review schema
- FAQ schema (if FAQ section present)
- Breadcrumb schema
- Article schema

**Blog Posts:**
- Article schema
- Breadcrumb schema
- FAQ schema (if applicable)

### Author Schema (All Pages)

**Use the exact structure from VOICE_AND_CREDENTIALS.md:**

    "name": "Associate of Applied Science in Culinary Arts"
  },
  "knowsAbout": [
    "Professional Cooking",

    "Culinary Equipment"
  ]
}
```

### Product Schema Best Practices

**Required fields:**
- name ✅

  "@type": "AggregateRating",
  ratingValue: "4",
  reviewCount: "1"
}
```

### FAQ Schema Structure

```typescript
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How long does the Vitamix 5200 last?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "I've used mine for 6 years in a professional kitchen. With proper care, expect 15-20 years of home use."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## 📅 Date Requirements

**Every page must include:**
- Published date (when first created)
- Last updated date (when meaningfully updated)
- Both dates in visible HTML
- Both dates in schema markup

**Format in HTML:**
```tsx
<time dateTime="2024-10-15">Published: October 15, 2024</time>
{' • '}
<time dateTime="2025-01-20">Updated: January 20, 2025</time>
```

**Format in Schema:**
```typescript
"datePublished": "2024-10-15",
"dateModified": "2025-01-20"
```

---

## 🔗 Canonical URL Requirements

**Every page must have a canonical URL.**

```tsx
export const metadata = {
  alternates: {
    canonical: 'https://www.chefapprovedtools.com/reviews/vitamix-5200'
  }
}
```

**Rules:**
- Always use https://
- Always use www.chefapprovedtools.com
- No trailing slashes
- Match the actual page URL exactly
- No query parameters

---

## 🖼️ Image Alt Text Requirements

**Every image must have descriptive alt text.**

**Format:**

  alt="Vitamix 5200 blender with 64oz container on kitchen counter after 6 years professional use at Purple Café"
  width={800}
  height={600}
/>
```

**Best practices:**
- ✅ Describe what's in the image
- ✅ Include relevant keywords naturally
- ✅ Include context when helpful
- ✅ Keep under 125 characters
- ❌ Don't start with "Image of" or "Picture of"
- ❌ Don't keyword stuff
- ❌ Don't leave alt text empty

---

# Part 5: Email Content System

**Last Updated:** November 11, 2025  
**Purpose:** Standards for email content (different from website content!)  
**Key Difference:** Emails use FRIEND voice, not ENCYCLOPEDIA voice

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Email Voice = FRIEND (Different from Reviews/Blogs!)

**Emails have DIFFERENT rules than website content. This is intentional.**

### The Friend Voice Strategy

**Website (Encyclopedia):** Attracts traffic, builds authority, educates broadly  
**Email (Friend):** Builds relationships, drives purchases, personalizes recommendations

**Why separate:** Different audiences, different goals, different conversion strategies

---

## ✅ What's ALLOWED in Emails (NOT on Website)

### Personal Stories
**✅ DO use in emails:**
- "Let me tell you about the time at Purple Café..."
- "When I was working the sauté station during a 250-cover Saturday..."
- "I remember learning this lesson the hard way at Mellow Mushroom..."
- Opening with restaurant experiences and anecdotes

### Specific Restaurant Names
**✅ DO use in emails:**
- Purple Café (primary reference, 2007-2012, Pizzaiolo role)
- Mellow Mushroom (Kitchen Manager, 3 years)
- Other restaurants where Scott worked (Feierabend, Il Pizzaiolo, Paragary's)
- Specific stories from each restaurant

### Personal Recommendations
**✅ DO use in emails:**
- "This is the exact one I use in my home kitchen"
- "I bought this one because..."
- "Here's my personal setup for..."
- "My family's favorite..."
- "In my kitchen, I only use 2 oils. Here's why..."

### First-Person Language
**✅ DO use in emails:**
- "I", "my", "me" throughout
- Personal experiences and observations
- Family mentions when relevant
- Home kitchen examples

### Story-Driven Format
**✅ DO use in emails:**
```
Opening: Restaurant story or personal experience
Body: Lesson learned or technique explained
Close: Specific product recommendation
CTA: Direct link to purchase
```

---

## ❌ What's STILL FORBIDDEN in Emails

Even though emails are more personal, these rules still apply:

### Credentials Must Be Accurate
- ✅ "24 years of professional kitchen experience" (correct)
- ❌ "40 years of cooking" (wrong)
- ✅ "6 years at Purple Café" (correct)
- ❌ "18 years at Purple Café" (wrong)

### Forbidden Phrases
- ❌ "game-changer"
- ❌ "let's dive in"
- ❌ "amazing" / "incredible" (overused hype words)
- ❌ "you won't believe"

### Pricing Rules
- ❌ Specific prices ("$49.99")
- ❌ "Best value" claims
- ❌ Cost-per-use calculations
- ✅ Can say "worth the investment" with context

### Honesty
- ❌ Fake experiences
- ❌ Exaggerations
- ❌ Products not actually tested
- ✅ Honest limitations and cons

---

## 📊 Email vs Website Content Matrix

| Element | Website (Encyclopedia) | Email (Friend) |
|---------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Personal Stories** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Restaurant Names** | ❌ Generic only | ✅ Specific names OK |
| **"I/My" Language** | ⚠️ Minimal, professional | ✅ Encouraged |
| **Anecdotes** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Credentials** | ✅ "24 years professional" | ✅ Same, but with stories |
| **Family Mentions** | ❌ No | ✅ OK if relevant |
| **Restaurant Specifics** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (Purple Café, etc.) |
| **Home Kitchen** | ❌ Avoid | ✅ Encouraged |
| **Buying Journey** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Personal Recommendations** | ⚠️ Generic | ✅ Specific ("I use this") |

---

## 📝 Example Comparisons

### Scenario: Recommending an 8-Inch Chef's Knife

**WEBSITE (Review/Blog) - Encyclopedia Voice:**
> "Professional experience in high-volume commercial kitchens shows that an 8-inch chef's knife handles 80% of cutting tasks efficiently. In professional settings, this size provides optimal balance between maneuverability and cutting capacity for most cooks."

**EMAIL - Friend Voice:**
> "Let me tell you about the time I worked the sauté station at Purple Café during a 250-cover Saturday night. I had one 8-inch Victorinox and that was it. That knife got me through 6 hours of non-stop prep and plating. Here's what I learned: you don't need a dozen knives. You need ONE great 8-inch chef's knife. This is the exact one I still use at home."

**See the difference?**
- Website: Professional observation, generic context
- Email: Personal story, specific restaurant, specific recommendation

---

### Scenario: Explaining Why Cast Iron is Great

**WEBSITE (Review/Blog) - Encyclopedia Voice:**
> "Cast iron cookware provides excellent heat retention and distribution when properly maintained. Professional testing shows these pans can last decades with basic care, making them economical choices for serious home cooks."

**EMAIL - Friend Voice:**
> "I've been using the same Lodge cast iron skillet for 18 years. I bought it right after culinary school for $25. That pan cooked thousands of meals at Purple Café, survived 4 moves, and it's STILL in my kitchen today. Here's why I'll never switch to anything else..."

---

## 🎯 Email Content Types & Voice Guidelines

### Onboarding Sequence (13 weeks)
**Voice:** Personal, educational, story-driven  
**Can include:** Restaurant stories, personal tool recommendations, "here's what I use"  
**Goal:** Build relationship, establish expertise through experience

### Product Recommendations
**Voice:** Direct, personal, specific  
**Can include:** "This is the one I bought", personal experience, why Scott chose it  
**Goal:** Drive specific purchase with personal credibility

### Technique Tips
**Voice:** Teaching from experience  
**Can include:** Restaurant shortcuts, professional methods Scott learned, stories of mistakes  
**Goal:** Provide value through insider knowledge

### Behind-the-Scenes Content
**Voice:** Conversational, insider perspective  
**Can include:** Restaurant industry insights, what Scott learned from mistakes, real kitchen stories  
**Goal:** Build connection through shared insider knowledge

---

## ✅ Email Content Checklist

**Before sending ANY email:**

- [ ] Uses personal stories (not just generic professional observations)
- [ ] Includes specific context (Purple Café, home kitchen, actual experiences)
- [ ] Credentials are accurate (24 years, 6 years at Purple Café, etc.)
- [ ] No forbidden phrases ("game-changer", "let's dive in")
- [ ] No specific prices or "best value" claims
- [ ] Honest about limitations (not just hype)
- [ ] Includes specific recommendation or actionable advice
- [ ] Links to relevant website content
- [ ] Clear CTA (what to do next)

---

## 🎓 Key Principle: Separation of Content Strategy

**The Rule:**
- Public content (website) = Encyclopedia = Attracts and educates
- Private content (email) = Friend = Builds relationships and converts

**Why it works:**
- SEO content needs authority and breadth
- Conversion content needs personality and specificity
- Different content for different stages of funnel

**Common mistake:**
- Putting personal stories on website (hurts SEO, wastes relationship-building content)
- Being too formal in emails (doesn't build connection)

**Solution:**
- Keep voices separate
- Website gets professional, educational content
- Emails get personal, relationship-building content

---

**Remember:** When writing emails, you CAN and SHOULD use personal stories, restaurant names, and specific recommendations. This is the ONE place where "In my kitchen..." and "At Purple Café..." are not just allowed—they're encouraged!

---
