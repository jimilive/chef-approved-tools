## üö® Issues & Recommendations

### 1. **Inconsistent Lead Magnet Offers**

**Problem:** Same lead magnet described differently across site:
- Exit Intent: "11 Tools I Use Most in My Home Kitchen" (45 years cooking)
- Newsletter Component: "7 tools I actually use daily" (24 years professional)
- Newsletter Page: "11 Tools I Use Most" (45 years total cooking)

**Impact:** Confusing user experience, trust issues

**Recommendation:**
- Decide on ONE lead magnet title and stick count
- Suggested: "The 11 Tools I Use Most in My Home Kitchen" (based on actual PDF)
- Update all components to match exactly
- Unify experience claim (recommend: "24 years professional" + "45 years total")

---

### 2. **Unused Component Warning**

**Problem:** `NewsletterModal` component exists but not used in layout.tsx

**Questions:**
- Was this replaced by ExitIntentModal?
- Should it be removed?
- Or is it used somewhere else?

**Recommendation:** Audit usage and either implement or delete

---

### 3. **Duplicate Exit Intent Mechanisms**

**Problem:** Two components can trigger on exit intent:
- `NewsletterModal` (trigger: 'exit')
- `ExitIntentModal` (dedicated exit intent)

**Risk:** If both were active, user could see two exit popups

**Status:** Currently safe (NewsletterModal not imported)

---

### 4. **Lead Magnet Content Mismatch**

**Exit Intent Promises:**
- 5 Victorinox knives
- 4 prep tools (peeler, scraper, tongs, mandoline)
- Bar mops
- Cutting board
**Total: 11 items** ‚úÖ

**Newsletter Component Promises:**
- "7 tools I actually use daily"
**Total: 7 items** ‚ùå MISMATCH

**Recommendation:** Update Newsletter component to match actual PDF (11 tools)

---

### 5. **Missing Analytics Tracking**

**Tracked Sources:**
- ‚úÖ Exit Intent: `professional-kitchen-bundle` (modal variant)
- ‚úÖ Newsletter Component: `footer-newsletter`
- ‚úÖ Newsletter Page: `newsletter_page`
- ‚úÖ NewsletterModal: `modal-{trigger}`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Contact Form: No newsletter tracking (different purpose)

**Recommendation:** All sources properly tracked via Google Analytics

---
