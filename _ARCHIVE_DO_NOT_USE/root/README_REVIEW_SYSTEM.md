## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Creating a New Review

1. **Copy the template:**
   ```bash
   cp REVIEW_TEMPLATE.tsx app/reviews/[product-slug]/page.tsx
   ```

2. **Replace all placeholders:**
   - Search for `[PLACEHOLDER]` and replace with actual content
   - Update productData object
   - Write your testing experience
   - Add 6-8 customer testimonials
   - Complete all required sections

3. **Run quality checks:**
   ```bash
   # Check for unescaped characters
   grep -n "It's\|don't\|won't" app/reviews/[product-slug]/page.tsx

   # Check for specific prices
   grep -n '\$[0-9][0-9][0-9]\.' app/reviews/[product-slug]/page.tsx

   # TypeScript check
   npx tsc --noEmit

   # Build test
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Deploy:** If all checks pass, commit and deploy.

### Updating an Existing Review

1. **Assess current quality** (see REVIEW_QUICK_CHECKLIST.md)

2. **Identify missing components:**
   ```bash
   # Find reviews needing updates
   grep -L "What Real Users Are Saying" app/reviews/*/page.tsx
   grep -L "Cost-Per-Use Analysis" app/reviews/*/page.tsx
   grep -L "Performance Metrics" app/reviews/*/page.tsx
   ```

3. **Add missing sections** (see REVIEW_CREATION_GUIDE.md, "Updating Existing Reviews")

4. **Replace raw affiliate links:**
   ```bash
   grep -n 'href="https://www.amazon.com' app/reviews/[product-slug]/page.tsx
   ```
   Replace all `<a>` tags with `<AffiliateButton>` component

5. **Run quality checks** (same as new reviews above)

---

## ‚úÖ Critical Requirements (Zero Tolerance)

### 1. NO Raw Affiliate Links
**‚ùå Wrong:**
```tsx
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/...">Check Price</a>
```

**‚úÖ Correct:**
```tsx
<AffiliateButton
  href="https://www.amazon.com/..."
  merchant="amazon"
  product="product-slug"
  position="above_fold"
  variant="primary"
>
  Check Amazon Price ‚Üí
</AffiliateButton>
```

### 2. NO Specific Prices
**‚ùå Wrong:**
- "This costs $299.99"
- "Priced at $450 on Amazon"
- "Only $199 right now"

**‚úÖ Correct:**
- "Check current price below"
- "Budget-friendly pricing"
- "$200-400 range" (acceptable for comparisons)
- "I paid $450 in 2007" (acceptable for historical cost analysis)

### 3. NO Unescaped Apostrophes or Quotes
**‚ùå Wrong:**
```tsx
<p>It's great for chef's knives</p>
```

**‚úÖ Correct:**
```tsx
<p>It&apos;s great for chef&apos;s knives</p>
```

**Find these errors:**
```bash
grep -n "It's\|don't\|won't\|can't\|I'm" app/reviews/[product-slug]/page.tsx
```

### 4. ALL Sections Must Have Matching IDs
**‚ùå Wrong:**
```tsx
<nav>
  <a href="#testimonials">User Reviews</a>
</nav>
<!-- Section has no id -->
<section>
  <h2>What Real Users Are Saying</h2>
</section>
```

**‚úÖ Correct:**
```tsx
<nav>
  <a href="#testimonials">User Reviews</a>
</nav>
<section id="testimonials">
  <h2>What Real Users Are Saying</h2>
</section>
```

## üîç Finding Reviews That Need Updates

### Quick Commands

```bash
# Find ALL reviews with quality issues
cd /Users/scottbradley/chef-approved-tools

# 1. Reviews using raw affiliate links (HIGH PRIORITY)
echo "=== Reviews with raw affiliate links ==="
grep -r "href=\"https://www.amazon.com" app/reviews/ --include="*.tsx" | grep -v "AffiliateButton" | cut -d: -f1 | sort -u

# 2. Reviews missing testimonials
echo "=== Reviews missing testimonials ==="
grep -L "What Real Users Are Saying\|Customer Testimonials" app/reviews/*/page.tsx

# 3. Reviews missing cost analysis
echo "=== Reviews missing cost analysis ==="
grep -L "Cost-Per-Use Analysis\|cost-analysis" app/reviews/*/page.tsx

# 4. Reviews missing performance metrics
echo "=== Reviews missing performance metrics ==="
grep -L "Performance Metrics\|Measured Performance" app/reviews/*/page.tsx

# 5. Reviews missing specs table
echo "=== Reviews missing specifications table ==="
grep -L "Complete Specifications\|Technical Specifications" app/reviews/*/page.tsx

# 6. Reviews missing competitor comparison
echo "=== Reviews missing comparison table ==="
grep -L "vs. Competing\|Comparison Table" app/reviews/*/page.tsx

# 7. Reviews with unescaped apostrophes (BREAKS BUILD)
echo "=== Reviews with unescaped apostrophes ==="
grep -r "It's\|don't\|won't\|can't" app/reviews/ --include="*.tsx" | cut -d: -f1 | sort -u

# 8. Reviews with specific prices (SHOULD REMOVE)
echo "=== Reviews with specific prices ==="
grep -r "costs \$[0-9]\|priced at \$[0-9]" app/reviews/ --include="*.tsx" | cut -d: -f1 | sort -u

# 9. Short reviews needing expansion
echo "=== Reviews under 2,500 words ==="
for file in app/reviews/*/page.tsx; do
  words=$(wc -w < "$file")
  if [ "$words" -lt 2500 ]; then
    echo "$file: $words words (NEEDS EXPANSION)"
  fi
done
```

### Priority Order for Updates

1. **Critical (breaks functionality):**
   - Unescaped apostrophes/quotes (prevents build)
   - Raw affiliate links (breaks tracking)

2. **High Priority (major quality issues):**
   - Missing productData object
   - Missing customer testimonials
   - Missing cost-per-use analysis
   - Specific prices in content

3. **Medium Priority (quality improvements):**
   - Missing performance metrics
   - Missing specifications table
   - Missing competitor comparison
   - Short word count (<2,500 words)

4. **Low Priority (nice to have):**
   - Fewer than 8 FAQ items
   - Fewer than 3 related products
   - Missing Quick Navigation

## üêõ Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Build Fails with JSX Syntax Error
**Cause:** Unescaped apostrophes (`It's` instead of `It&apos;s`)

**Solution:**
```bash
grep -n "It's\|don't\|won't" app/reviews/[product-slug]/page.tsx
# Replace all with escaped versions
```

### Issue 2: Affiliate Links Not Tracking
**Cause:** Using raw `<a>` tags instead of AffiliateButton

**Solution:**
```bash
grep -n 'href="https://www.amazon.com' app/reviews/[product-slug]/page.tsx
# Replace with AffiliateButton component
```

### Issue 3: Quick Navigation Links Don't Work
**Cause:** Section missing `id` attribute

**Solution:** Ensure every Quick Navigation link has a matching section:
```tsx
<a href="#testimonials">User Reviews</a>
<!-- Must have corresponding: -->
<section id="testimonials">...</section>
```

### Issue 4: Schema Validation Fails
**Cause:** Incomplete productData object

**Solution:** Verify all required fields:
- name, slug, brand, model, category
- priceRange (min, max, currency)
- rating, reviewCount
- pros, cons (arrays)
- affiliateLinks (array)
- expertRating, expertOpinion
- dateAdded, lastUpdated

### Issue 5: TypeScript Errors
**Cause:** Missing imports or incorrect types

**Solution:**
```tsx
// Ensure these imports are present:
import { Tier2Badge } from '@/components/ReviewTierBadge';
import FTCDisclosure from '@/components/FTCDisclosure';
import AffiliateButton from '@/components/AffiliateButton';
import { generateProductReviewSchema, generateBreadcrumbSchema } from '@/lib/schema';
import Link from 'next/link';
import type { Metadata } from 'next';
```
